        <h1><a name="top"></a>Navigation Buttons for SSO&#160;Users [BETA]</h1>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>: This feature is currently in beta and will be implemented only for select clients.</p>
        <p>A new button on both the Firelight App Home Page and the Firelight Admin Home Page allows users who log in to Firelight through SSO to navigate between the Firelight App and the Admin app without having to re-authenticate through their SSO provider.</p>
        <p>For users for whom this enhancement has been enabled, the Firelight App home page has in the Manage section a button that says To FireLight Admin, and the FireLight Admin home page has in the Support section a button that says To FireLight App. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/ToFireLightAppButton.png" /> <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/ToFireLightAppButton.png" /></p>
        <p>Clicking this button from either Home Page takes the user to the desired page without having to reauthenticate through their SSO provider.</p>
