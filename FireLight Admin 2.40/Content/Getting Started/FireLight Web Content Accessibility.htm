        <h1>FireLight Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h1>
        <p>We are still working on enhancements to support Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) - Level A. More information is provided about breaking changes.</p>
        <p>Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is critical to navigation for individuals who require assistance with web use. Assistive technology is also negatively impacted as a result of web content that does not conform to defined accessibility guidelines. There are three levels of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliance: A, AA, and AAA. The levels of accessibility are broken down into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). Enhancements are needed for FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for Level A. FireLight will continue to be enhanced in future releases to work toward the desired accessibility of Level AA. </p>
