        <p>FireLight® Pre-sale Diagrams</p>
        <p>FireLight® supports three different workflows that reflect the aspects of a presale case. Following are Visio illustrations of the workflow options.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Admin Basics for Setting Up Pre-Sale</p>
        <p>Pre-Sale is creating a new activity that will precede an activity that follows. Several places within the Admin allow configurability to the pre-sale. This section details each one.</p>
        <p>Activity Detail</p>
        <p>Activity Name</p>
        <p>The Activity Name can be configured to a business need. This allows for the user to name their activity specific to what they’re trying to accomplish. When adding a new Activity, this will need to be altered.</p>
        <p>ACORD Type</p>
        <p>ACORD Type drives the activity and associates it with Products, Packages, and Sales Agreements. This has replaced the Transaction Type from previous releases and makes an activity and package accessible to both a carrier and distributor. The type chosen will reflect the ACORD value associated with it.</p>
        <p>Activity Type</p>
        <p>This feature is attached to the ACORD Type and is locked down as it cannot be altered.</p>
        <p>Branding Icon</p>
        <p>The icon reflected in FireLight® can be configured by the client. The icons are featured from FontAwesome, and a link is provided to view each professional icon. The textbox can be altered, and the name of the icon needs to be entered to display the chosen icon.</p>
        <p>Continue/Apply Button</p>
        <p>A value can be entered to customize the label of the Continue button.</p>
        <p>Allow Pre/Post Signature Review</p>
        <p>These checkboxes are mutually exclusive and allow for a pre-signature or a post-signature pre- submission review. This option can be chosen along with a post-submission review.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bypass New Activity Prompts</p>
        <p>This feature allows you to skip choosing the jurisdiction and product if only one product and one carrier is set to this activity. This feature applies only to the initial activity. For example, if there was only one Needs Determination listed for the Activity, then once selected in FireLight®, it will immediately launch the forms listed:</p>
        <p>Edit Activity Pop-up messages</p>
        <p>Select pop-up and toast messages can be customized based on the client’s business need. If a user wants to return to the default message, a selection can be made to change the message. These messages are cached, so it will take 20 minutes for changes to be reflected.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Next Activity</p>
        <p>Add in the Next activities that will be associated with the Pre-sale. Multiple next activities can be associated with the Pre-sale and will be displayed once the Pre-sale activity has been submitted.</p>
        <p>If only one Activity is selected for the Next Activity and only one product is associated with that Activity, it will bypass the Jurisdiction and Product type menu and open up the next Activity</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>without displaying the menu. If multiple products are associated with the next activity, the normal FireLight® prompts appear.</p>
        <p>Groups</p>
        <p>The Pre-sale activity needs to be selected for each role code in the Activity tab to be visible.</p>
        <p>Setting Up Workflows</p>
        <p>Using Buttons to Drive Next Activity</p>
        <p>Buttons can be edited to lead the user to the next desired activity. This is located within the Activities section of the Product Config tab in the Admin. Under Activity Detail, the Continue/Apply Label can be configured to reflect the activity that needs to occur. An example could be Illustration. In this example, “Illustrate” is used as the label and is reflected in FireLight® once an Activity has been completed:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If there is more than one activity listed in the Next Activity list, then there will be a dropdown displaying the choices:</p>
        <p>There is no limit N how many activities can be added to the Next Activities list.</p>
        <p>Select Jurisdiction and Product Inside of Pre-Sale and Move into Application</p>
        <p>The product and state selected in the pre-sale option can be set up to prefill for the next activity. There are two FireLight® global data items that need to be set on the parent activity (FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_PRODUCT_CUSIP and FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_JURISDICTION). These data</p>
        <p>values can be collected in input controls (dropdown lists or custom lists). In the pre-sale activity, set the data items, and then use these values for the subsequent application. If the values are specified and available, the user will automatically move into the next activity with these values.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Example using dropdown lists:</p>
        <p>Setting the data item to an ACORD value:</p>
        <p>Please NOTE: The State code needs to be added as the export value to execute this action.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When more than one ACORD type is listed for the next activity, a dropdown is presented upon pre-sale completion for the user to select which activity they would like to complete next. Once the activity is chosen from the dropdown, the user will be routed to the product chosen from the CUSIP.</p>
        <p>If the selections are not valid, the user does not have access to create the product and jurisdiction, or the steps are not taken to set the next activity jurisdiction and product, FireLight® displays a message to the user and the user needs to go through the normal activity creation workflow. In the Admin Help, see FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_PRODUCT_CUSIP and FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_JURISDICTION in the “Common Tags” topic, CommonTags.xlsx spreadsheet for more information.</p>
        <p>Using Rules and Next Activity Options</p>
        <p>A new dataitem has been created to reflect the Next Activity through ACORD type. This is FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_ACORDTYPE, and this dataitem can be utilized to specify the next Activity.</p>
        <p>For example, to have an illustration show for the next activity when multiple activities are listed, add the following rule:</p>
        <p>&lt;diset dataitemid="FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_ACORDTYPE"&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;const value="111" type="String" /&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;/diset&gt;</p>
        <p>Even though multiple activities are listed within the field properties, the rule will designate the activity reflected.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Utilizing the Needs Filter through Pre-Sale</p>
        <p>The Needs filter can be used to create a greater filter for the pre-sale activities. Within the groups tab, the Needs filter can filter certain next activity products based on dataitems and export values.</p>
        <p>An example would be if a product needed to be filtered based on the Owner’s age. The age would be added along with the products needing to be filtered down:</p>
        <p>Once the value is entered into the pre-sale and the user is advanced to the next activity, the needs filter shows the products they are allowed to select based on the query.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Please NOTE: The Needs Filter is based on the selected role code, so multiple filters can be created if there are multiple role codes.</p>
        <p>For more information about the Needs Filter, please see the Admin Help.</p>
        <p>The Deployment Process</p>
        <p>When deploying a Pre-Sale either into the higher environments like Staging and Production or deploying into a distributor environment, there is not much of a change with the current deployment process. The difference is the configuration for activities. For both carriers and distributors, the activity name will have to be created.</p>
        <p>If a carrier is deploying to a distributor, the current process of pairing the package to the product for that selling organization is the same within the Sales Agreement; however, the defining item is that the package is set by the ACORD Type that is the same as the Activity.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>While the activity is not deployed to distributors, the product and package are and will be tied to the distributor’s activity through the ACORD Type. This gives the opportunity to the distributor to name the Activity according to their business needs but still tie the carrier’s product and package to it.</p>
