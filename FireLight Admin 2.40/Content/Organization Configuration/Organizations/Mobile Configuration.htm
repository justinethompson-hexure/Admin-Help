                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Max Check-Out Applications</b> Maximum number of applications that can be offline (checked out) at one time per device. The default is 10 applications. If no maximum, type 0.</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Max Check-Out Days</b> Maximum number of days the application can be kept offline (checked out).

                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Min Numbers in Password</b> Minimum numbers required in the Password. (The default is the same as Minimum Password Length for backwards compatibility.)</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Min Symbols in Password</b> Minimum symbols required in the Password. (The default is 0 for backwards compatibility.)</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Login Attempts Window (Seconds)</b> The number of seconds allowed for authentication attempts. If the Max Login Attempts is exceeded within this time frame, the Wipe On Failed Login setting is checked to determine if the data should be deleted from the mobile device.

If no maximum, type 0.</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Max Login Attempts</b> Maximum number of Password entry attempts before the application is locked or wiped clean. The default is 3 attempts. The minimum is 1 attempt. If no maximum, type 0.</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Wipe On Failed Login</b> Select the checkbox to wipe the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> data from the device if the number of failed login attempts is exceeded. The default is cleared (unchecked).</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Idle Timeout (Seconds)</b> Number of seconds of idle time before the Console is locked and the user is required to type a Password to re-log in to the Console. The default is 300 seconds. If no maximum, type 0.</p>
