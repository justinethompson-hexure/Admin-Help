        <p>IT Vendor role view provides the ability to add a new firm, as well as the list of firms that have been set up for a main organization with the option to update or delete. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> The list is a global list that applies in all scenarios, i.e.: Firm 4444 information is global for all Firm Management and does not vary across organizations. Read-only view for the main organization allows a display of only the firms and the data entered by the vendor role.</p>

        <h2>Firm ID/Case Access Identifier</h2>
        <p>The “new” Firm will be a different identifier than the “old” hierarchical Firm/Case Access /Office identifier (firm information from FireLight Access will also be tied to the “old” firm / case access identifier).</p>
        <p>For backwards compatibility, if the group does not have a Firm associated with it, the following fields and data items will be populated with the “old” Case Access firm identifier and name (what is passed in the FirmRegistrationNum/FirmName for the associated agent party in the 1228):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_FIRM_ID data item</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_CASE_ACCESS data item</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_FIRM_NAME data item</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>User FirmID property</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>User CaseAccess properties</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Activity FirmID property</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Activity CaseAccess property</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Going forward, CaseAccess/FLI_CASE_ACCESS should be used instead of FirmID / FLI_FIRM_ID for hierarchical firm related logic, and all base logic related to Case Access by Firm ID will use CaseAccess / FLI_CASE_ACCESS.</p>
        <p>The following identifiers will continue to be used for the “old” Firm Case Access logic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_CURRENT_FIRM_ID</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_CURRENT_FIRM_NAME</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_ORIG_FIRM_ID</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a group does have a Firm associated with it in Groups profile, the following fields and data items will be populated with the “new” firm information configured in Firm Management profile in Admin:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_FIRM_ID data item (Firm ID)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_FIRM_NAME data item (Firm Name)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_DTCC_ASC_FIRM_ID data item (Associated Firm ID)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FLI_DTCC_ASC_FIRM_NAME data item (Firm Name)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>User FirmID</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Activity Firm ID</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Product Access</h3>
        <p>Regarding creating new activities/products, the system will now limit the products list by Jurisdiction and Jurisdiction defined in the new hyper link in the product access tab. The system does not use the firm ID specifically on the EGApp side. The system only uses the group access product ID.</p>
        <p>For this new logic, we modified the FillUserGroup method to include two new parameters. These two new parameters are related to the new JurisdictionApproval and AdditionalJurisdictionApproval columns added to the GroupProductAvailability.</p>
        <p>This new limitation is populated in the AccessibleProductInfoCollection. This new collection contains the jurisdictions for every individual product.</p>
        <p>Now we need to either call the UserGroup from everywhere we need to restrict products by jurisdiction or pass in the UserGroup object.</p>

        <h2>Delete a Firm</h2>
        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> When a user clicks the Delete link to delete a firm, the firm has the IsDeleted flag set to true. The firm will remain in the table until the user either restores the firm or the firm is removed via the Purge Process. This allows FireLight to keep the normal process for deleting entities, maintaining history of deleted firms, and maintaining how FireLight does deployments.  Additionally, it allows users, who accidentally delete a firm, to not be constrained by the uniqueness of Firm ID, Name, etc., when setting the firm back up.</p>
