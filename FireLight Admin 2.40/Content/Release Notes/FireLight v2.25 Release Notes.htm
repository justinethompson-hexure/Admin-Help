                <p>This new feature enhances usage of data grids and navigating through the rows within the data grids. There is a new XML rule node created to allow writing efficient rules to loop through the rows in data grid and assigning values to another data item in the wizard. Adding this new rule node will reduce the number of lines coded for cases such as funds allocation, making rules management efficient for client's forms development team.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260014 </b> Copy activity logic and data item properties. Problem: The latest fix was found to cause a side effect of no longer locking data items for a next activity when Lock Transferred Data Items is enabled (TFS 33675). Resolution: Moved the logic into the correct location and do not reset data item properties if it is a next activity with Lock Transferred Data Items. Problem: The original fixes for this were incomplete. 1) The changes to reset Enabled / Visible / ReadOnly data item properties on a copy with changes were not having an effect because it was being done before the provider had been called to copy the original app data items. 2) The changes to reset Enabled / Visible properties when opening an activity for data entry corrected the issue for the combined wizard UI, but introduced the original problem in legacy forms UI (which worked correctly before this fix). Resolution: 1) Corrected the copy with changes logic to reset the data item properties after the provider copies the app data. 2) Modified the logic to reset properties when loading an activity to operate on the original data collection, rather than a clone of the data items, so they will not be incorrectly synced back to the rules collection in the legacy forms UI (the common tag sync logic is specific to data item values and doesn't handle other properties consistently). <br />Areas Impacted: Read-only state of data items on copy to next activity. Data item enabled/visible properties initialization on copy with changes and prior to rules execution</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260682 </b> CRM - Remove popup that generates when Clear is selected for Product Search input fields. Problem: This is occurring not because a provider-base action isn't assigned.  The script code specifically checks for any button in the group being disabled, and if so, displays the Disabled message when clicking one of the buttons.  Since the SEARCH button is disabled, it results in the Disabled message being displayed when clicking on CLEAR.  Resolution: Removed the code to display the Disabled popup. <br />Areas Impacted: CRM</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Moved the updating and processing of the FLI_PERCENT_COMPLETE data item to be after the initial rules run, and after the Model.PageMap and the Model.ShowValidationMap got refreshed.</p>

                    <li>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 263500 </b> Continue popup message showing for activity that has no Continue step. Problem: The data entry complete popup (for which the default text is "Data Entry has met the requirements. You may enter more data or CONTINUE to proceed to the next step.") is always displayed for an activity when it reaches 100%, and there is no way to suppress the message, but it is contradictory and confusing to display this message if there is no continue action possible for the activity (the reported example is Print Forms activity, which cannot be saved and does not have a continue action). Resolution: Modified the logic to not display the data entry complete popup if continue is not an available action (this includes activities that can't be saved, such as Print Forms, and also if Disable Save Applications is enabled in group options). NOTE: This fix is specific to activities in data entry status (for instance, excludes pending review, activity finished steps) and also excludes some activity types (fee inquiry and needs determination), which have their own popup messages, and these popups will not be suppressed even if continue is unavailable.  Some of these popups have default text that mentions Continue.  It would require more research to determine if and when it might be appropriate to suppress popup messages for other statuses and excluded activity types.  It may also be beneficial to allow/support empty messages to be configured for specific popups in Activity profile to suppress those popups. <br />Areas Impacted: Data entry complete popup at 100% complete</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 263663 </b> Error Message covering field. Problem: A legacy forms validation warning was blocking the input field. Resolution: Due to the design of the form designer, validation messages are positioned using the absolute position of the input on the page, plus an offset to make the message higher. This offset is designed for single-line messages. The warning message in this case was multi line message. I styled validation warning messages to force them to fit on a single line. This also matches the current styling for validation warnings, which are also forced to fit on one line. <br />Areas Impacted: Applications using legacy forms that contain validation warning messages</p>

Problem: The changes to limit jurisdictions for products at the group level was not correctly handling groups that did not have jurisdiction limitations, resulting in no jurisdictions being listed in some situations.

FireLight has 3 test environments (UAT, UATNext, &amp; Staging).  Clients needs to be able to submit apps from any or all of the 3 test environments to the DTCC test region.  This can result in duplicate DTI rejects by DTCC if the same DTI or sequence number is used for activities from multiple test environments. Resolution: To reduce the likelihood of a duplicate, modify the base system to use different prefixes for DTI_Number &amp; DTCC_Number counters returned from the appService.GetNextIncrementalNumber and BackOfficeProviderBase.GetSequenceNumber methods: in UATNext, the first digit of the number is replaced by the digit "5" and in UAT, the first digit of the returned number is replaced by the digit "9." NOTE: This could still result in duplicates if the current counter actually does start with 5 or 9, but it will reduce the possibility. <br />Areas Impacted: DTCC </p>

Problem: There was a problem with the implementation of 263658, which had the result of altering the app sub values for some premium method / premium type / account type values for existing providers.  Because the digital payment enumeration was not added to the end of the list, existing values following it were all shifted up to the wrong value, when converting from the enumeration to the app sub value. Resolution: Corrected this issue so that existing provider value mapping will not be affected. NOTE: It is necessary for the provider to be recompiled with the latest definitions after this is incorporated into the release. <br />Areas Impacted: DTCC app sub generation</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 263659 </b> Email Group and Failed Email Notification fields no longer allowing multiple email addresses. Problem: Previously, email validation in FireLight did accept multiple email addresses separated by a comma or semicolon character (in addition to invalid email addresses like abc@xyz@123.com). That ability was removed with the fixes for iConnects 260693, 262060, and 261044. The system now: a) requires a single email address when validating email fields, and b) validates the email address at the point of sending, throwing an error instead of sending a message to a To address that is multiple addresses. Resolution: Modified email validation to accept multiple email addresses separated by semicolon or comma characters for the following fields: Organization -&gt; Failed Email Notifications, Review Queue -&gt; Email Group, and Sales Agreement -&gt; Deploy Email Group. Intentionally, the system will not allow multiple email addresses to be entered in most email fields (particularly not for fields that could be a From address, but also for cases where there is a To name also entered, and for legacy reasons this is not being enabled across the board). <br />Areas Impacted: Entry of email addresses in the above fields</p>
