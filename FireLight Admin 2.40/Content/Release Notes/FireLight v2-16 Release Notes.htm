                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 202565</b> Formerly, when a distributor used Copy with Changes they were allowed to copy the activity to another carrier’s product. When this happened, AppSub codes from the original case could remain in the new case’s AppSub file. Now when Copy with Changes occurs, the base system clears the case of any data related to the prior carrier to prevent data from being retained and potentially being transmitted in the AppSub file. When Copy with Changes occurs, the base system clears the case of any base, provider, rule and unknown scoped data related to the prior carrier, but retains the user-entered and 103 pre-filled data. The clear provider will apply to both Copy with Changes across carriers and Copy with Changes in the same carrier. Once the user data and 103 pre-filled data are applied, the new provider will run.     This prevents  product  data from being retained and potentially being transmitted in the AppSub file. This update will remove any potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that could be passed to another carrier.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 184406</b>  Created a FLI_CRM_PREFERENCES_NAME global dataitem to identify the CRM Preferences active for the logged in agent. The export values of Redtail, Salesforce, Whitepages, NPIS, or None is set based on the agent's Preferences setting. This allows carriers to create wizards to interact with the CRM Preferences setup for the logged in agent. Firms can write rules associated with the CRM Preferences. For example, if Salesforce is set up in the CRM Preferences for the logged in agent, display the Pull data from the Salesforce custom action button.</p>

                <p>When a user creates a new Dropdown List field in a wizard or a Combo Box field in a form and adds a common tag in the Name field property, the autocomplete feature automatically adds the Item Source list values  to the field. If the Name of the drop-down list field is not a common tag, autocomplete does not add the Item Source export list values to the field and all values must be entered manually.</p>
                <p>A user can update the Item Source on existing dropdown list fields by clicking the Reset Default button in the Item Source dialog.</p>

                <b class="DRnumber">CMR 213031 </b> This enhancement includes two improvements to the Common Tag Conversion tools that were introduced in 2.14.  The two improvements were identified during demos and training.  Prior to this release, the spreadsheet only included the common tags in the downloaded report and it did not include the Export Values.  Secondly, we did not have a way to only identify the data items that are not common tags.  With 2.16, these two issues have been addressed.  We added logic to include all export values from the forms and wizards as well as the common tags. This will help the user and eliminate the need to go back to the forms to determine the export values and enter the values manually into the spreadsheet.  Additionally, we added a checkbox on the Download tag list page to determine if Non-Matching Common tags are in the download tag list tool. This checkbox is used to include only tag names that do not align with our Common tags in FireLight. Clients will still be able to pull all values simply by not checking that box. </li>

This package history/audit report is similar to the existing history/audit report for forms and rules available currently. It will have a timestamp, indicate the user making the changes and indicate the timestamp of the change. This enhancement will help the carrier admin manage form and wizard updates, package changes, product updates, product changes, sales agreement updates, and sales agreement changes. This will also allow a user to triage Package, Product, and Sales Agreement issues such as forms being incorrectly added or removed from the Packages, changes to the Products, and Sales Agreement changes that can impact correct workflow.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 202519</b> Expanded the FireLight APIs to support hitting FireLight to run rules and return validation messages and data item IDs. With this project, firms can use the FireLight Rules API for any activity type (needs determination, presale, e-Application, etc.) and return dataitem ID values and validation messages. The input is a JSON file passed to FireLight via the API. The FireLight rules will run and return a response of updated dataitem ID values and validation messages. This will give carriers/distributors the ability to leverage all of the rules already built into FireLight for other channels. Licensing is required to use this API.</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 199769 </b> Added the ability to obfuscate data on screen so that it cannot be seen by individuals walking by in high traffic areas, such as bank lobbies. Users can selectively display the data. When focus is on a given field, the contents are visible. The user can display all of the data on a page to review for accuracy by clicking a toggle button in the page title bar to show or hide all data entry on the page for a limited period of time.  Obfuscation encompasses all fields on the UI—fields in both carrier and distributor form packages and FireLight UI fields that are part of the activity workflow.  </p>
                <p>Obfuscation Impacts:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Admin – Groups, App tab: Under Obfuscation/Screen Security settings, added "Enable Obfuscation"  and "Timeout" options for enabling obfuscation and setting the number of seconds for the data to remain visible in periods of inactivity. In Timeout, an entry of zero (0) = None, which means data is obfuscated immediately.</li>
                    <li>FireLight UI: Added a <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture83.png" alt="Obfuscation Icon" title="Obfuscation Icon" /> toggle button to the page title bar the user can click to show the data or click the <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture91.png" alt="Obfuscation Toggle Button - Hide Data" title="Obfuscation Toggle Button - Hide Data" /> toggle button again to hide the obfuscated data on the page.

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 204819</b> Added FireLight support for post submission status changes and post submission agent notifications of the status change. The workflow includes the provider polling an outside source to return the current status. FireLight updates the Display status and External status in the Recent Activities and All Activities as well as notifies the agent of the status change. Notification to the agent occurs with the status change, an onscreen icon, message center update, and an email with the details of the status.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> Review queue statuses have been updated as a result of this project.

                                    <li>Status In Review More Info Requested is now Review: Info Requested. </li>
                                    <li>In the external status, the Review Status will now reflect “Carrier Status” and display the new post-submission statuses, which include: Approved (Carrier status), Declined (Carrier status), and Further Review (Carrier status). Once an activity has been submitted to a carrier after form entry, signatures, and review queue approval, the Display status will change from "Complete" to "In Carrier Review."</li>

                            <li>Recent Activity and All Activities Icon (new for only Post Submission Statuses). When a notification comes through the Provider post submission polling call, a message center "envelope" <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture84.png" alt="Post Submission Message Icon" title="Post Submission Message Icon" /> icon displays next to the post-submission activity on the Home page in the Recent Activity list and on the All Activities page in the activities list.

                    <li>
                        <p>API Impact for anyone using the External Review API – Review Statuses will now display in the Display status. There should be no impact to this service, but testing will need to be performed by clients who have this implemented to verify this works as expected.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Audit History - FireLight generates audits for the post submission status changes, which the user can view on the Other Actions menu, History dialog or from the All Activities page, activity audit View History link to open the History dialog.</li>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 199470 </b> Introduced a new database partition for Hexure to manage products, forms, packages and sales agreements that are not sponsored in FireLight (owned and managed by a carrier) and deploy those to distribution. We are calling these Print Only products. All forms and packages managed by Hexure that do not have a supporting carrier to receive submission will only be available for Print; hence, they are called Print Only Products.</p>
                <p>Hexure can load and manage any form a distributor needs available in FireLight for a Print Only activity including account opening paperwork, mutual fund forms, 529 forms, life forms, etc. Additionally, Hexure can manage rate tables and product details when a sponsoring carrier does not want to manage these tasks themselves.</p>
                <p>Access to products: Distributors is able to access these forms using the same carrier/product/jurisdiction selection available today for the existing activities, but non-sponsored products will use the Print Forms logic. The package type delineates the activity type (Application, Post Issue, etc.). Added a new "Include Print Only Products" setting in each existing activity (except E-Delivery) in the Admin/Product Configuration/Activities page. This setting allows a one-stop location for agents to access both full sponsored activities like e-Applications and Print Forms. Distributors will still need to grant product access, but if the product is enabled, these non-sponsored products is available under the normal application, subpay, print form, post issue, quote, and illustration activities. If accessed via application, quote, illustration and post issue, FireLight logic will identify that the product is non-sponsored and only allow Print. e-Signature will not be available for non-sponsored forms. Upon submit, no submit will occur. Distributors, Licensing is required to use these forms.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 198094 </b> Provide Link to FireLight App from Review Queue History - Added the ability, by group user role, to open a PDF link to the History tab in the Review Queue. Reviewers now have the ability to open a PDF of the FireLight application in the Review Queue History after the application has been approved and submitted to the carrier, or rejected by the reviewer.</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 205762</b> Automated Review Queue - Added the ability to support fully automated review queues with automated web service calls within the review queue that will provide automated approvals and rejects. The automated review queue  performs web service calls through the use of the provider, which allows clients to build customized review queue workflows with the specific web service call needed to support the desired workflow. For example, clients can use this workflow and the provider to build automated queues for underwriting reviews, funds availability checks, NIGO checks, etc. As the web service is triggered, response messages is sent to the queue (i.e., reject or approve) to move the activity either to an approved-submitted or rejected status. </p>
                <p>In the Reviewer dashboard, FireLight adds an indicator for the review type so it is easy to identify the PreSubmit Review, Post Submit Review, and any automated review queues.</p>

                    <li>Admin: In Organization Configuration on the Review Queue page: added a "Queue Type" column to the grid that indicates to the user whether the queue is Automated, Post-Submit, or Pre-Submit and added an "Automated" checkbox and "Automation Retry Interval" minutes field that are required along with the current "Deadline Length" days for automated queues.</li>
                    <li>FireLight UI: Added the queue name to the current display status messages and added the Automated Queues section to the Review Queue. See the <em>FireLight  Review Queue Guide</em>, in the Post-Submission Review Process see the "Automated Queues" section.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Updated the expiration Deadline Length day checking to run once every hour instead of once every day.

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 204820</b> Provided a means for carriers to test inside of the distributor environment. The distributor needs to activate this view with a setting in the Admin, but if activated, the carrier is able to select the distributor to test and transition into their agent view. This provides the carrier visibility of how the carrier forms and rules function inside the distributor's environment. Carriers can also submit orders from the distributor environment to test outbound feeds. In Admin Help, see "Carrier Testing as a Distributor" in Features for Admin setup and user instructions.</p>

                <b class="DRnumber">DR 203738, 208663 </b> Save As results in error with Disable Copy Activities group option. Save As was not working for the Illustration or Quote activities when the "Disable Copy Activity" group option was selected. This was fixed by hiding the "Save As" button in activities other than  the Illustration or Quote activities, but still showing the "Save As" button in the Illustration and Quote activities, when the "Disable Copy Activity" group option is selected. </li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 206659 </b> Deployment - detect mismatched package info. Deployments sometimes caused mismatched package information. Implemented checks for missing package information to allow issues to be corrected without support intervention. </li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 206920 </b> Carrier Custom List Deployment - Include Carrier Name. The carrier organization name was not showing in the Organization column on the Deployments page when the distributor selected the Carrier Only Custom List Configuration synchronization scope. This was fixed.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 208422 </b> Quote rule set was visible to non-vendor user in the form designer. Hidden rule sets should not be visible to non-Vendor users. Removed the Quote rule set from the Form Designer/Rules Window and from the Wizard Designer/Edit Rules window. <br />Areas impacted: Package details when you first navigate to the packages view without selecting a package in the package list.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 208837 </b> Admin deployment feature considered wizards as having changed when up to date. It affected deployment of Form, Distributor Form, Package, Distributor Package, All, and Distributor All synchronization scopes. This was fixed by modifying the additional data check to exclude wizard forms. <br />Areas impacted: Deployment of Form, Distributor Form, Package, Distributor Package, All, and Distributor All scopes.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 209878 </b> Custom list upload bugs. When uploading a custom list, the logic did not exclude empty values, which should be excluded, and if there were duplicate column names, the message "Cannot upload the list. Column names must be unique." was not shown to the user.  It still reported that the list was uploaded even though it wasn't. This was fixed.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 210760 </b> Could not create a new Supported Services Configuration for API Access. The Supported Services section of the Organization Security page was occasionally losing certificates, and neither vendor nor individual organizations were able to edit the checkboxes for API Access, Illustration Access, Embedded, or IDP. This was fixed by updating the page to allow any organization to edit their own services, as long as they have the list profile entries needed to enable them. <br />Areas impacted: The Supported Services section of the Security tab in the Organizations page.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 212389 </b> PostMessage Rule node allows a null message. The PostMessage node was allowing the message to be null, which caused null reference errors later when using that property. This was fixed. If the PostMessage node receives a message that is null we convert it to an empty string. <br />Areas Impacted: All Rules processing.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 212911 </b> Rule node getCurrentFormNumber throws with null reference. The logic to get the page number  was not handling a null value from FLI_CURRENT_LOCATION. This was fixed. If FLI_CURRENT_LOCATION is null then the logic defaults to an empty string. <br />Areas Impacted - Rules that use getCurrentFormNumber</li>

            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 209003 </b> Batch / multi-life view was not working. This was fixed.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 213280 </b> Status for completed applications is "Review: Info Requested" instead of "Complete." This was fixed by updating the SQL migration script for external status in UATNext. Some older purged apps may still show this way, but the majority should now show "Complete."<br />Areas Impacted: Completed applications in All Activities.</li>

Application cannot be created with an application name longer than 255 characters due to database character limit on the column. This was fixed. Added a limit in the create new application text field for Name.  Also added in a truncation of the application name with ellipses indicating it had been truncated for post-over and API app creation. <br />Areas Impacted:  Create new application through UI, post-over, API, copy app. </li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 211720 </b> If a product name has a special character (a period) then the product name doesn't show in the Summary dialog from the Other Actions menu.

            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 213135 </b> Replacement product notification was not working. Notification for when a product has been replaced was not showing in FireLight. This was fixed. Modified logic to check if it has been replaced to pull the information directly from the database as what was stored in memory was incorrect.<br />Areas Impacted: Edit application page.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 213331 </b> Unable to open application created from 103 with Use Resident State sales agreement option. The applications were being created via a 103 in the SSO, which does not have a provision for setting the resident jurisdiction, and it gets set to 0 (which is not a valid jurisdiction), resulting in an error when opening the application if the 'Use Resident State for Form Selection' sales agreement option was enabled. This was fixed by modifying the system to use the app jurisdiction for the resident jurisdiction when resident jurisdiction is 0.<br />Areas Impacted: Initializing of application forms when opening activities in the legacy e-Application and the combined wizard+forms UI.</li>

These issues were fixed. Modified the copy application logic to: (1) Process removing of unused data items after initializing and running rules in the model and with the current form definitions.  Previously, processing occurred before rules ran and based on the original application forms. (2) Only consider data items that do not exist on any form in the application (whether included or not).

This allowed the signature to be verified and completed even there was no valid signature. This was fixed.

                <b class="DRnumber">DR 213509 </b> Tele-Sign Auto Submit Email Generating on Decline. After a Tele-Sign signer declined via the API, the agent clicks the Done button in FireLight. FireLight tries to redirect to the List of Required Signers page. At that point, the application process thinks that all signatures are complete because the Tele-Sign process was removed, and therefore the auto-submit email is sent. This was fixed. Changed the workflow to add a new Declined page between the Done button click and the redirection. Now, a message is shown (similar to decline with regular e-Sign) which tells the agent that the Tele-Sign signature has been declined or canceled. Since the application is back in data entry at that point, a button is shown to bring the user directly back to the edit application screen, bypassing the signers screen where the auto-submit email was being sent.<br />Areas Impacted: Tele-Sign decline signature process.</li>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 212842 </b> QENext Error message inconsistency. Error messages were often overlapping or hidden by other elements within the Firelight UI. This was fixed. For the issue with overlapping messages on fields that are close together, there are a couple of options: (1) added a new Error Placement property to Wizard fields, which allows clients to set error placement on fields within the Wizard Designer, (2) for radio buttons and checkboxes that have the same data item ID, clients can use the NoPopup option in the postmessage rule. This will still show the field in an error state, but will suppress the popup message. <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="29">For the latest z-index issue, when the navigation buttons are not fixed to the bottom of the screen, the field validator popups should have a higher z-index than the buttons so the popups display in front of the buttons, which was not happening.
