                <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Update to Support “Distributor Only” Forms for Back Office Transmissions: EAES-5027, EAES-6452</b>
                </p>
                <p>In the Admin Tool, we added an option to the form Detail “Send to Distributor Only” to support the handling of forms that should only be sent to the distributor.  In Firelight we added the functionality required to support this new option.</p>

                </p>
                <p>If enabled for an organization, the completion of a transaction will generate a Transaction Detail Report. The report captures a comprehensive record of information related to a transaction, including wizards, forms, and other key points of data. The feature can be enabled at the organization level and permissions can be adjusted at the group level for more fine-tuned access.   We also added a new option on dropdown/combo box controls which, when enabled, will limit displayed values in the Transaction Detail Report for that specific field.</p>
                <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Updates to the DPFA Upload to Accommodate Additional Scenarios for Carrier Appointments and Commission Options: CR-4308</b>
                </p>
                <p>We addressed a DPFA issue where duplicate carrier appointments are generated due to improper handling of CarrierCode and DistributionChannelCode elements in the file. To resolve the issue and prevent future duplicates, the NAICGroupCode is introduced in the system.   This will uniquely identify and associate each carrier appointment entry to prevent duplication when dealing with carriers that share the same CarrierCode and DistributionChannelCode.   The "Commission Option" dropdown in FL UI is now a text field. This is done to account for the different versions observed in the DPFA.</p>
