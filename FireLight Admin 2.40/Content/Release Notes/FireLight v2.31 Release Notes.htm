        <h1>FireLight v2.31 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>August 18, 2023, Production</h2>
        <p>FireLight August 2023 Release – 08/14/2023</p>
        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <h3>Active Signer Types: Update to allow Active Signers to be used in rules</h3>
        <p>A new well known data item is created, FLI_ACTIVE_SIGNER_TYPES. It is a comma delimited string that contains a list of all of the Active Signer Types, and if there are no active signer types, the DataItem is an empty string. The list of possible signers is all of the signer types in the Signer Type dropdown, but the data item will only show those that will complete a signature. The Active Signer Type Names will always be in English, and this DataItem will only work on activities that are Auto Saved.</p>
        <h3>Add a Data Item to Identify Review Queue Name in Emails</h3>
        <p>The existing email replacement tag &lt;QUEUE_NAME&gt; for review queue name is made available for Post Submit RQ email templates. This replacement tag is used in the email templates under the category “Review Queue” to identify the review queue referred to when approval/decline emails are sent.</p>
        <h3>Add Auto Deploy Column to Sales Agreement Admin Report</h3>
        <p>A new column “Auto Deploy” has been added to Sales Agreement admin report. This column will have value “True” or “False” for each sales agreement in the report.</p>
        <h3>Address Errors when Running Agent Activity reports.</h3>
        <p>Update report architecture to prevent “deadlock” issues when running activity reports.   This includes updates that impact the following reports:</p>

        <h3>Activity Completion Admin Report</h3>
        <p>A new Activity Report has been added “Activity Completion Report” that will display the completion duration of an activity sent for remote signature.  This report will track the duration from log in to signature completion</p>
        <p>Non FireLight User Login time stamp is retained when they login using a link.</p>
        <p>When an External users logins into Firelight via a link for Client Fill and Sign, Client Fill, Remote eSignature or  PreSubmit Review Queue the login timestamp is retained.</p>
        <h3>Update the Lexis Nexis integration to include Emailage via a custom Action parameter</h3>
        <p>We are adding "LexisNexis Emailage" as a Custom Action Parameter.   The custom action type will still display as "LexisNexis," but the Action Parameter will allow the user to select "LexisNexisEmailage" in the textbox.</p>
        <p>Update the Lexis Nexis integration to include InstantID via a custom Action parameter</p>
