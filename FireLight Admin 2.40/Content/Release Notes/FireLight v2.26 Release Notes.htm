            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 256732 </b> Multi-Life applications not submitting. Problem: Batch Async Methods have not been updated for new Factory Design. Resolution: Moved to Async Runner for async call. <br />Areas Impacted: Batch App Page</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 264531 </b> Unable to Search by Policy Number in FireLight. Problem: If the FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER data item was set from a callexternal rule, if the data item did not already exist, it would not get created (the rule system requires all data items to be initialized when the activity is loaded). A workaround for now is to write a rule to initialize the data item on new activities. Resolution: Modified the base system to always initialize FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER and FLI_APPLICATION_CONTROL_NUMBER data items to an empty string at app creation.  It was already clearing an existing value on a copy.  Extended the logic to create the data item if it doesn't exist.  So if it is updated in a callexternal rule, the change will take effect. <br />Areas Impacted: Existence of above data items on new activities</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266575 </b> Sporadic null reference exception opening activity. Problem: Null reference exception was occurring looking up OfficeUseOnly field property that did not exist, preventing load of the activity. Resolution: Added null checks to handle non-existent field property. <br />Areas Impacted: Load of activity for data entry</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 267543 </b> Client able to request passcode for expired fill &amp; sign request. Problem: There was no existing check for the request being expired before sending an SMS passcode. This led to the situation where a passcode could be sent for an expired request, causing the link to simply go back to the request page. Resolution: A check was added for whether or not the request was expired on the click of the 'Send SMS" button, and an error message was added for when the request is expired: "The Request is no longer valid. Please contact your agent and have them send you a new request." <br />Areas Impacted: External requests: specifically client fill and client fill and sign when SMS text is selected for a client</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 268989 </b> Application creation is missing the spinning indicator. Problem: Changes related to updating jquery-ui version for security finding (iConnect 254935) introduced a problem, and the id tag was no longer being set for buttons like the Create button on new activity, which prevented disabling the button. Resolution: Updated the jquery-ui library to assign the id tag. <br />Areas Impacted: Buttons and other elements in FireLight UI, and behavior tied to the element ID.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269872 </b> Receiving Generic Error Closing Firm Orgs on Sales Agreement Page. Problem: On closing Firm Org popup on Sales agreement, it was showing error.

While working on TFS#34562, we fixed the issue on the All Activities page for Enrollment Activity when the "Disable Delete All Activities" group flag is on. This change will impact other activities, and we need to change our logic to fix this for all activities. Resolution: We need to add a group flag "Disable Delete All Activities" condition into the code for Enrollment Activity also. <br />Areas Impacted: All Activities page</p>

Problem: During the test period for Azure, the on-prem URLs cannot be used, and temporary test URLs are used instead.  The console service endpoints had not been updated to use the temporary endpoints, so running the console app was failing when connecting to the console service. Resolution: Update the console service endpoints to the temporary test endpoints. <br />Areas Impacted: Offline Windows console</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269268 </b> Deployments Synchronization Scope Mapping not loading.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269272 </b> Deployment History Statistics Time Zone. Problem: In Azure, the app service operates in UTC, so converting to local time shows as UTC instead of Mountain time zone. Resolution: Explicitly convert the UTC time for deployment history to Mountain time zone, for compatibility with on-prem environment. <br />Areas Impacted: Deployment history timestamps</p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269273 </b> Deployment Schedule not triggering at scheduled time. Problem: In Azure, the app service operates in UTC time zone, so converting to UTC was not advancing the time from the user-entered time value to UTC, causing deployments scheduled a few minutes or hours in the future to run within minutes of when they were scheduled. Resolution: Explicitly convert the entered scheduled deployment time from Mountain time zone to UTC, for compatibility with on-prem environment. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Deployment times of scheduled deployments</p>

Resolution: This has been corrected. Additionally, a change was needed for UAT Azure to temporarily use the UATNext SendGrid account for the webhook settings, which required an appSettings change.<b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> STG and PROD Azure are not setup for the callback to get those notifications.  We are using the UATNext environment in SendGrid for UAT Azure (and regular UAT in SendGrid for UAT on-prem), but we don't have alternative accounts for Staging &amp; Production which are still servicing on-prem FireLight.

Problem: If the clients embedded workflow includes starting a new session using a new cookie without reloading the page, the proxy server will use the previous session.

Problem: The FireLight WCF service endpoints were not responsive in Azure.  The first issue is that the app firewall was incorrectly flagging the endpoints as unsecure and blocking the request.  The second issue is that the endpoint URLs were configured as http because on-prem, SSL was being offloaded to the app firewall.  Since that is no longer the case in Azure, the endpoint was not listening on port 80. Resolution: 1) Adjusted the app firewall policy to allow the request to the service endpoints.  2) Converted the service bindings to https since SSL is no longer being offloaded. <br />Areas Impacted: FireLight WCF services</p>
