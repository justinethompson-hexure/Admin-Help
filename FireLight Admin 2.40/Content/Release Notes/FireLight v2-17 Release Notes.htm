For pre-sale, e-Delivery, Quote and Illustration activities, the Save As button was visible in child activities when the Copy button was not. Since Save As creates a copy, the same logic should be applied to both Copy and Save As buttons. Added a check to the Save As button to ensure the activity is not a child of any other activity before making the Save As button visible. <br />Areas Impacted: Any toolbar</li>

DKIM is a cryptographic protocol based on the use of public and private keys that allows emails to be signed with the domain name, which provides the email authentication.   The FireLight DKIM signing process is added for emails generated with a "from" domain of firelighteapp.com or other domains.  The outgoing emails are signed with the appropriate DKIM key. </p>
                <p>Emails that originate from the FireLight system and the domain "firelighteapp.com" are automatically signed with the FireLight DKIM certificate, no setup is required. If you would like to add a DKIM signature to emails that are sent from your domain, you can configure the DKIM settings in the Admin tool.  See the DKIM design document in the Admin Help for instructions.</p>

Previously, when accessing the GetActivityDetails API, the response included 4000+ dataitems.  The GetActivityDetails API sent all of the dataitems for a single requested activity, which could include 4000+ dataitems.   The GetActivities API sent specific high level activity details like status for all activities requested, and the option to include additional dataitems did not exist. With this enhancement, a small collection of dataitems can be sent to FireLight and the values of those dataitems are returned back, as well as the existing collection of data. This is needed for both the GetActivities and GetActivityDetails calls to provide the user the information they are needing, whether that be multiple activities or greater detail on just one activity. With sending the subset of information, this provides the user with the exact detail they are needing on each activity.</p>

                    <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">Hooli 9010</MadCap:conditionalText> The LexisNexis functionality is upgrading to a new platform, which means that FireLight is required to engage in this update.&#160;This impacts all clients that are using the Lexis Nexis service. All of the old implementation is removed and the new Lexis Nexis service is supported after this release. We will upgrade to the Lexis Nexis RDP platform from the current Lexis Nexis IDM platform.  From a user standpoint, the impacts is non-apparent.  But from a technical impact, everything behind the scenes has changed, meaning the APIs are different and the LexisNexis service is different.  You will definitely want to test it.  Please note that Lexis Nexis has to move your account over to the new service.  Clients using the service will need to work with their PM, Product, and Lexis Nexis to coordinate the process.  Lexis Nexis will require clients to sign a new Schedule A  and then LexisNexis will need to assign the new workflow to your IDs.  At that point, clients is able to test this. </p>
                <p>As part of this enhancement, the FireLight team is adding additional functionality to make it easier to implement the solution.  The support of Data Group and Data Group Properties are now supported in addition to the mapping tool.</p>

                    <li>LexisNexis third-party service - Third-Party Configuration Service - Lexis Nexis has to move your account over to the new service.  Clients using the service will need to work with their PM, Product, and Lexis Nexis to coordinate the process.  Lexis Nexis will require clients to sign a new Schedule A  and then LexisNexis will need to assign the new workflow to your IDs.</li>
                    <li>E-Signature – There should not be an impact with the user experience, but clients will want to test the e-Signature workflow, Forms - Signature Controls, and Mapping.</li>
                    <li>Mapping – Data Groups and Mapping Tool have been used for this service.</li>
                    <li>Admin – Under Organization Configuration on the Organization Settings page, Admin tab: clients need to update the Third-Party Service Configuration credentials for LexisNexis to include the following four credentials: Username, Password, AccountID, and Workflow. <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> In the new LexisNexis service platform, AccountID and Workflow are used to create the service endpoint, so slashes (/) are not allowed.

                    <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">Hooli 9033</MadCap:conditionalText> Added the ability for LexisNexis to be called during the data entry workflow to validate the person.  This is a new Lexis Nexis implementation that is managed using a custom action button inside the activity.    Once the button is selected, a call goes to LexisNexis, which then sends back an Instant ID and scores associated with validating the user.  With this code, rules can be written to display a message giving the user instructions on how to proceed.  Using rules, the admin can define how many times the user can select the Validate button. Added a report that the initiating organization can run to access the LexisNexis usage. The FireLight team added functionality to make it easier to implement the solution.   Data Group and Data Group Properties are now supported.</p>

Multiple-Activity serves as a  "Parent" activity that is linked to "Child" activities. Multi-Activity supports a generic collection of party data in the Parent once, then allows that data to be leveraged in all of the Child activities without reentering that information multiple times. Because of the unique characteristics of this workflow, it is a unique activity/transaction type of 1204. </p>
                <p>To set up the new Activity Type called Multiple Activities (1204), there is a UI setup process that is defined in the design document. In Admin Help, see the "Multiple Activity" topic in Features.</p>

                    <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">Hooli 9480</MadCap:conditionalText> Review Queue Script Workflow. Modified processing for the review queue script and moved the review queue script from deploying with Organization to deployment with Review Queue. Modifying the review queue workflow will eliminate production support issues where the client deployed the review queue script, but did not deploy the review queue. The review queue script displays in the deployment list as selected for deployment by default. The selection can be removed manually in instances where the user intentionally wants to deploy only the review queue without the script. An example of this situation may be the admin made changes to the review queue, but no changes were made to the review queue script. The admin only wants to re-deploy the review queue without the script, so the selection on the review queue script deployment can be removed.</p>

                <p>Currently when the group setting "Enable  Single User to Sign Multi Signer Types" is selected, multi-sign is enabled.  The use case for multi-sign is when the same person is multiple roles, example Owner and Payor are the same person.  During the Signing selection, the agent will select multiple roles for the signer, but the review process is not actually consolidated to represent the multi-selected roles.   The user is presented with the same form multiple times and receives multiple completed document emails.</p>
                <p>With this release, multi-sign consolidates the review process so that the multiple roles are combined into one review and signing workflow. The screens and audit are labeled to represent the multiple roles. The emails are consolidated into one email when multiple roles are selected. This email contains one link for the user to access the application. The Application Audit report lists the user roles selected during the signing.</p>
                <p class="note">
                    <strong>IMPORTANT! </strong> The “Group Name” field property for Signature Box and Signature Initials controls is negatively impacting the Multi-Signer enhancement. In the Signature Box and Signature Initials controls, Group Name is used to create document sets which are useful when you must have separate and sequential signing ceremonies for each document or set of documents, i.e., E-Signature/E-Consent forms must be signed separately and in advance of signing the rest of the application. If you do not have such requirements, there is no need for Group Name in the Signature Box and Signature Initials controls.<br />If you plan on using the Multi-Signer enhancement and you do not require separate and sequential signing ceremonies for a specific circumstance, the FireLight team developed a script that removes the Group Name field contents from all Signature Box and Signature Initials controls, which eliminates the need to go into each Signature Box and Signature Initials control and remove the Group Name content manually. Contact your Strategic Account Manager if you would like this script run in your test region.</p>

Fixed the "Show All" button so it no longer resets the search. Now, if the user types "Robert" and clicks "Show All," the user will see all users that match "Robert."

Resolution: (1) modified the base system to assign a data source of User for all inbound data items initialized by the integration provider, including when mapping from a 103, and re-enabled the logic to clear non-User data items when copying applications, note: there is a provision to exclude specific provider data items from being removed when copying, by adding data items to copyWithChangesExclusions.config,  (2) do not clear all FLI_ data items when copying applications.  These will get removed on copy with changes due to #1, but will not (and should not) get cleared on copy as-is.  But always clear the value of FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER and FLI_APPLICATION_CONTROL_NUMBER data items after copying the app data from the source application, since these should never carry over.<br />Areas Impacted: Copy/Copy with Changes</li>

(2) The first page of the custom list will appear now, however no values are displayed when typing a value in the search bar or select a letter to search on.

Rolled back changeset 38145.  In tests, custom list search and first letter matching are now both working correctly in wizard and legacy forms -- clicking a letter finds all items beginning with that letter, and entering a search term (even if previously filtered on a starting letter) and searching matches all items containing the search term.

This caused a massive size increase (from 2.5x to 9x, depending on the original document size) to all outbound documents (PDF and XML attachments). The effect of this would be a) the Firelight database storage space quickly being consumed, b) significant increase in server load when generating PDF documents, and c) many receiving servers being unable to process the much larger data payload, so this change must be backed out. This means that some functionality for the previously mentioned work order may not function correctly.  Unfortunately, it is probably too late in the development cycle for this to be safely corrected, and it is necessary to investigate a possible solution for a future release that does not balloon file sizes.

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 219532 </b> Pop-ups showing multiple times when forms and wizards are in the same package. There was no check in the Wizard processing to ensure that duplicate pop-up messages could not occur. This was fixed by adding a check for duplicate pop-ups in Wizards; the same method existed for forms.<br />Areas Impacted: Opening and creating new applications with wizards, would also need to have a rule to trigger the pop-up</p>

                <b class="DRnumber">DR 219556 </b> Wizard UI screen needs to fit when the page size is 125 percent. The error list pop-up was ending up below the bottom of the page when being viewed on small screen that were zoomed in. This was fixed by updating the styles for the dropdown to stop at the bottom of the page.<br />Areas Impacted: The error list in wizards and wizard/forms in the same UI</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 219636 </b> Possible to have fields outside the designer in the Form Designer. Fields were able to be copied offscreen. Default behavior always moved fields 15px to the right and down, even if they were at the edge of the screen. This was fixed. Added checks to see where fields are on the page. If the field is too far right or down, move the field 15px to the left or up instead, if space allows. <br />Areas Impacted: Form Designer, when any fields are copied that are close to the top and/or right edge.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 219943 </b> Producer First Name and Last Name fields were showing errors when they should not. Fields in wizards would keep incorrect error state once any page change occurred. Once you moved away from the first page of the application, validation messages would no longer go away, although the percentage complete and page error list was correct. This was fixed by adding code to merge the error set together and remove orphaned error messages. <br />Areas Impacted: All wizard fields that can contain errors. Form-only products are not effected.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 220259 </b> Wizards could not be rendered in QENext environment. In cases where empty labels exist, FireLight was looking for a particular value, which was causing the field to crash, followed by the application. This was fixed by adding a check for empty labels before executing code.<br />Areas Impacted: Any label fields in Wizards</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 220279 </b> Wizard - Issue with schedule rules and null values. Schedule rules were throwing an exception when a schedule had a blank value. Fixed a bug in the Schedule parser that made it so the it could have handle anything but valid numbers.<br />Areas Impacted: Illustration</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 220977 </b> Wizard - numeric only masked fields do not allow zero. Masks were set to treat '0' as an empty value, which would cause the field to be cleared. This was fixed by setting the mask handler to treat 0 as a valid value.<br />Areas Impacted: Masked fields using numeric masks.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 221073 </b> Custom List search is not working. This was fixed. Searching within letter searches is now working properly. To remove the letter search, clear all text from search textbox and click the search button.<br />Areas Impacted: Custom Lists searches</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 221079 </b> Wizard - Inline partial error messages do not show pop-up with second validation message. When a validation message changes from shorter (fitting in the space below the field) to longer (expanding past the field and being truncated), the popup was not being reset and told to show up. This was fixed. Cleared the popup code when validation message changes to recalculate whether or not popup needs to be available.<br />Areas Impacted: All wizard fields when validation messages change depending on field content.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 221203 </b> Wizard - validation messages not displaying after document upload. Upload document upon close would clear out all validation. If a document was uploaded, the model would be reloaded, but the parameter for the upload type was not being sent because of the wrong parameter name. This was fixed.<br />Areas Impacted: Custom action document upload and Other Actions document upload when a document is actually uploaded.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 221299 </b> Wizard - Input Type: Number Field Properties with a Mask - cannot input data. When both a mask and an input type of number were selected on a forms field, no input could occur on the field in the wizard data entry screen. This was fixed. Set wizard fields to act similar to form fields in that if both mask and input type are selected, only use mask. This needs to happen since almost all masks have a non-number character ('-', '%', '$', or others). <br />Areas Impacted: Form/wizard text fields that have masks and input types.</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 221301 </b> Wizards do not properly show that a template form is required. A form template can be hidden using the data entry visibility rule.  If the template is set to conditional and is still being included, it is counted in the percent complete.  The validation error for the template form is not being shown in the error list because of it's visibility property. This was fixed. Now if the form that is not visible is a template form, then still add it to the error list to allow the user to know that the template must be updated.<br />Areas Impacted: Template forms</li>
            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">DR 222004 </b> Wizard - Delayed screen updates / freezing UI when updating fields. Field updates were slow - most likely due to the change for identifying OfficeUseOnly errors in order to update the Toolbar. This was fixed by changing the way in which we detect OfficeUseOnly errors.<br />Areas Impacted: Field Updates on wizards, OfficeUseOnly (specifically updating the toolbar to allow for Client Fill &amp; Sign after satisfying all required OfficeUseOnly fields)</li>

                <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="78"> Wizard - Zip code field not getting cleared immediately. When a masked field was cleared that had two parts to the mask ('99999?-9999'), only a partial clear was occurring. The masking library was preventing changes to the mask and the value at the same time, so the mask would change to '99999' while the value would stay in place. Updated masking library to allow both the mask and the value to change at the same time. Patched UATNext 4/10/2020.</MadCap:change>
