                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 256054, 256066 </b> Invalid characters in the element name. Problem: In 2.22, the characters in the field name/Data Item ID were limited to only letters, numbers, underscores and brackets. Resolution: Allowed all characters except apostrophes in the field name/Data Item ID. <br />Areas Impacted: Updating the field name in forms and wizards designers</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 256110 </b> Canceling e-signature request removes all review queue information for activity. Problem: When revoking an e-signature request (really, any request type), all review queue information for the activity was also being deleted. Resolution: Only remove review queue information when canceling an e-approval request. <br />Areas Impacted: Cancellation of requests</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;255588 </b> Suitability Packages not populating at end of AOE in "Print Documents" last page. Problem: It appears the Packages and Forms are out of sync between the DB and Session State. These applications add a package when the rules are initially run. This new package adds the suitability forms, but because the DB doesn't reflect the change in forms they are not available when printing. This seems to only happen in Embedded instances. Resolution: Ensure activity is saved in Wizards when packages are included/excluded. (Ensure Package Changes will trigger an autosave when loading Embedded application.) <br />Areas Impacted: Embedded activities that include/exclude packages at startup</p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 256106 </b> URL missing for CORS in UAT. Problem: CORS Headers are not being returned in the Proxy specific calls. Resolution: Automatically returning the CORS headers for Proxy specific calls. <br />Areas Impacted: Embedded clients using the Proxy server would see this when calling renderPDF() in the JavaScript client UI.</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255551 </b> Incorrect save audits with auto save. Problem: The seconds in the audit of activity updates was displaying x minutes y seconds, with y being the total number of seconds for the time span instead of the number of seconds more than x minutes. Resolution: Corrected the audits to show the correct number of seconds. <br />Areas Impacted: Save activity audits</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255613 </b> Unable to create or edit activities. Problem: Changes related to common tags introduced a null reference that could occur when disposing of the rules engine. Resolution: Added a null check. <br />Areas Impacted: Editing of activities</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255628 </b> No scroll bar on Quote UI - UAT or Staging. Problem: As part of feature development, hidden overflow css style was added to a common layout page. At some point, the quote page was mistakenly added as part of the pages that should have hidden overflow. Resolution: The quote page was removed from those that have hidden overflow. <br />Areas Impacted: Quote page</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255640 </b> Enrollment Activity - Unable to save sales agreement. Problem: In 2.22, the Acord Type "1204-13000 -- Enrollment" was added with IsNonInsurance = false.  Therefore, the system will not allow adding packages of this type to a sales agreement for a non-insurance product. Resolution: The AcordTypes list profile for Enrollment should be configured with IsNonInsurance = true. Applied a migration script to correct this issue. <br />Areas Impacted: Enrollment activity</p>

Problem: Identity Verification was incorrectly judging default SSN numbers and birth dates as dates and values that should be validated against.

Problem: The changes for TFS 26701 incorrectly were using the broker org instead of the carrier org for the distributor SA view, causing the view to not load correctly. Resolution: Switched back to using the broker org.  And corrected the default selected org to be the distributor org when showing the distributor SA view. <br />Areas Impacted: Admin Sales Agreement profile for distributor</p>

Problem: The changes for TFS 26701 incorrectly were using the broker org instead of the carrier org for the distributor SA view, causing the view to not load correctly. Resolution: Switched back to using the broker org.

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255707 </b> Change in behavior of CheckBox fields on forms. Problem: A recent change was implemented to convert all legacy checkboxes to radio buttons. However, sometimes, when the export value in a radio button is boolean, e.g. "true," and the value is set by the rules without specifying the type as String (e.g. &lt;const value="true" /&gt;) the actual value stored in the data item is capitalized, e.g. True/False, which is interpreted as not a match. The same issue is in wizards and fillable forms. Resolution: Corrected the handling of the checkboxes and the radio buttons when the export value is boolean. Fixed the handling of checkboxes and radio buttons when the export value is boolean, in wizards and fillable forms. NOTE: A workaround is to specify the type as String when updating the checkbox or radio button value in rules, e.g. &lt;const value="true" type="String" /&gt;. <br />Areas Impacted: Check boxes and radio buttons behavior in forms, wizards, and fillable PDFs</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 254567 </b> FireLight Illustration - Illustration is not Included with Application Packet. Problem: Linked illustration was visible in the edit application view when it replaced a linked illustration template in an application but would not be visible in the application after the app was locked and did not appear in the signing ceremony even when a signature control was present on the linked illustration template. Resolution:  The linked illustration document type needed to be added to the document types pulled in the application forms after lock as well as the template document types pulled for signing. <br />Areas Impacted: Document types included in the types queried in the creation of the locked case and the creation of the signing ceremony.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255104 </b>FireLight Illustrations Base gender mapping incorrect for life products. Problem: The gender was not setting correctly because it expected a string value for the dataitem to convert to an int value.  The gender was already set to an int value and so would be set to the defaulted Female. Resolution:  Added a condition to check if the value has been set and is already an int value string and if not, then set the insured gender.  This ensures the gender is set for use in the illustration call. <br />Areas Impacted: Data for Life illustration products when clicking the illustrate button</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255552 </b> Error showing print dialog. Problem: The changes for addendum forms in 2.22 introduced a bug where an error could occur when generating documents for print with addendum forms if no document metadata, causing exceptions in Production for several organizations. Resolution: Added a null check. <br />Areas Impacted:&#160;Print/PDF functionality in legacy forms, combined wizard+forms UI, and REST API.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;255776 </b> Soft Limit Addendum no longer transmitting with App Packet. Problem: With the changes to addendum forms in 2.22, if an addendum form came before its related form in the document list (in the internal document list), it was getting dropped from the document list returned to the provider. Resolution: Ensure an addendum form is always included following its related form. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Generating of document list for integration providers (BODocumentService) and printing during and after signing</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255520 </b> Using SSOGateway to launch into eSign fails when App Declined ESign is true. Problem: The Landing Controller evaluates whether a redirect to eSignature is valid by checking the organization features, role code options and application. If the eSign has been declined on the application record then it determines we cannot redirect to eSignatures and fails. Resolution: We need to circumvent this validation when eSign has been declined as long as all other organization features, role code and application options are valid. This is needed for Embedded clients that use the eSign logic to lock and auto-submit the application even when e-Signatures are declined. <br />Areas Impacted: Clients entering FireLight with a relayState of 'eSign' in order to open an application and start the E-Signature process.</p>

Problem: The fixes for iConnect 253450 were missing some null checks, resulting in an error when dismissing the dialog if the document was already uploaded.

Using a new csv setting at an activity level,  firms can define the products to hide from the product selection drop-down when new instances of that activity are created. This will allow firms to hide products that are not ready for the agent to access in that activity. This might be used for distributors that want to make illustration available to agents so they cannot deactivate the activity but need to hold a few products back from the illustration. Additionally, this can be used for firms that need the agents to go through the presale for a product. The product can be hidden from the application drop-down but remain visible in the presale drop-down. </p>

The Admin\Sales Agreement page will include a new option called Manage Sales Agreements that will include a selection for multiple Selling Orgs, Copy Agreement, Delete Agreement, Save Batch, and Delete Batch. This option will enable admin users to save the batches of orgs to use in the future for quick management of multiple Sales Agreements. </p>

                <p>Primary Rule Sets are required in a Forms or Wizards when there are rules with Form Index. Today, replacing a Rule Set in the package breaks the linkage between Form Index fields on the form/wizard and the rules written using Form Index fields. Rule Sets are intended to be swapped in and out of packages for product changes but the current breakage when there are Form Index makes the swapping more difficult. With this enhancement, when swapping rule sets in a package, the swap window will present a list of packages that have the original primary rule set and provide a checkbox swap the Primary Rule Sets in the Forms and Wizards that have the original Rule Set. This swap will occur in the Package level to reduce the chances of missing a location where the Rule Set swap would break the Form/Wizard Form Index. </p>

Problem: The organization selection in the API Insights profile was implemented incorrectly, allowing carriers to see other carrier's API traffic in their distributors' environments. Resolution: Modified the organization selection: 1) Default to "All Trace Data," which will load all trace data from the logged in organization's partition. 2) When an organization is selected:&#160;a) For vendor role, distributors, or if the selected org matches the logged in org, filter the trace data to include only API traces for the selected organization. Note that this is limited to application-specific requests. b) For carriers, when selecting a distributor org, load trace data from the specified org partition, but limit trace data to the carrier organization (again, limited to app-specific traces). Also corrected: 1) The Username field showed as "()" when there was no associated user for the request.  Now, show a blank string in this case. 2) Long column text was overlapping and difficult to read.  Modified to prevent overlapping column text. 3) There was legacy code to look up the request URL, but the system now always stores the URL, so this obsolete code was removed.<br />Areas Impacted: API Insights</p>

Problem: The changes for TFS 25137 - "Text box field property 'Max Length' is not working when text box value set via rules" causes this behavior -- since the field max length is 9, the rules are now enforcing the max length, which results in the value being truncated and masking not applied when the raw value is 123456789 and the formatted value is 123-45-6789. Resolution: Rolling back changeset 51665.  We will not be implementing enforcing of max length in rules at this time, due to client impacts.

However, when this is used within our CSHTML pages the quotes can conflict with quotes in the immediate area the text is inserted.

But once the activity is Complete none of the uploaded PDF pages are shown. Resolution: Most activities use the EditApplication controller/views after the activity is locked.

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255228 </b> Scroll Up not working / Date not displaying in Wizard. Problem: Recent changes to the wizard/eApp page which moved the scroll bar into the main view of the eApp page had a side-efffect of causing overflow to be hidden. This in turn caused dropdowns and date pickers that would overflow from that scrollable element to be cut off/hidden. Resolution: For non-scrollable wizards, the overflow was simply changed to visible. For scrollable sections (where the overflow has to be hidden for the scroll to work properly), the settings and placement priority were adjusted. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizards</p>
