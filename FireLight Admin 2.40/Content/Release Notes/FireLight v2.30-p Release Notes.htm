        <h1>FireLight v2.31 Release History</h1>
        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE: Documentation for this release is currently incomplete and in a "DRAFT" status.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>July 10, 2023, Production</h2>
        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>An Activity Completion Report showing the completion duration of activities sent for remote Client signatures is now available. The report tracks how long it takes a client to complete a case, from login to signature completed. Report inputs are similar to the Application Audit report filters, and the Application dropdown lists only those activities whose signatures are completed.</p>
