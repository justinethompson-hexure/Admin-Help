        <h1><a name="top"></a>FireLight v2.36 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>July 2024 Release—7/25/2024 Production</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 16pt;">New Functionality</b>
        </p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Ensure That DPFA DTCCMemberCode Maps to NSCC Code to Avoid Manual Changes in the DPFA File: CR-2941</b>
        </p>
        <p>Today, organizations enter any value on the organization code in the DPFA File to execute Commission Netting, making the matching cumbersome in Firelight. In addition, organizations do not want to make any manual edits to the DPFA File to match their codes within FireLight. Therefore, Firelight is automatically matching the DTCCMemberCode in the DPFA File for Commission Netting with NSCC Code in the Organization Settings, so the users do not have to make any manual changes in the DPFA XML File.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Update Source of Lexis Nexis Login Credentials: CR-3051</b>
        </p>
        <p>When a Lexis Nexis InstantID call is kicked off from a carrier form or wizard, the credentials used should come from the carrier’s organization setup. We are finding that one distributor has not had successful results returned and the root cause is the distributor’s credentials. The ask is not to be dependent on distributor configuration to get results for our LexisNexis InstantID call.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Add a Disclaimer Underneath Organization Label within Commission Netting Table: CR-3280</b>
        </p>
        <p>As part of Day 1 for Commission Netting Release, we are adding the following disclaimer within Commission Netting Table, specifically underneath Organization label: "This is an alpha version of the Commission Netting functionality. Please refer to the Implementation Guide for more information."</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">New Activity Report to List Application Not Signed: DIST-2082</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Application Status report currently lists applications sent for review. This enhancement additionally lists applications not yet signed by client nor agent.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Application Status report lists cases from all agents that are pending signatures.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Admin User Changes for Ease of Use: DIST-3230</b>
        </p>
        <p>To facilitate ease of use and to make searching behavior consistent on the Sales Agreement (SA) page, text search has been implemented for Product and Package searching.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Add Bold Property to Fields to Allow Display Labels as Bold: DIST-3235</b>
        </p>
        <p>With this enhancement, users will be able to bold the labels for fields that allow label text. This feature will be available for fields on the wizard designer.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>Admin: Add a new field property “Make Label Bold” to the fields that allow label text on the wizard designer.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Add Required Property to Input Fields to Apply Required Rule to the Data Item: DIST-3386, DIST-3452, DIST-3626</b>
        </p>
        <p>With this enhancement, users will be able to set a data item as required from its field properties on the wizard designer. This new property will eliminate the need to write a rule to make a data item as required on the app side. Though, the required property on the data item can be setup from with wizard designer, the rule will apply on the form too if the data item exists on the form present in the application.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>Admin: Add a new field property “Required” to the fields on the wizard designer that require user input, such as Text Box, Drop-Down, Check Box, Radio Button, and DatePicker.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Record Success Log for Activity Reports Delivery via FTP: DIST-3413</b>
        </p>
        <p>Currently, when activity reports are sent via FTP, there is no record if the reports were delivered successfully, with only delivery failure being recorded. This enhancement records the activity reports log successful delivery of reports via FTP.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>Support user can view successful delivery of activity reports sent via FTP.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Enhancement for SSH Auth to Deliver Activity Reports: DIST-3417, DIST-3423</b>
        </p>
        <p>Currently, activity reports can be delivered via FTP and email methods. FTP can be set up using UN/PWD authentication. This enhancement is to support Public/Private key authentication for FTP configurations.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Allow entering Private Key info when entering FTP configuration info for activity reports.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FL Admin &gt; Organization Config &gt; Organization Settings &gt; Admin (tab) &gt; Activity Reports FTP Info (link)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Modify Sales Agreement Admin Report to List Data for Firm Orgs: DIST-3628</b>
        </p>
        <p>Due to the implementation of Firm Orgs and its utilization in sales agreement, there is a need to update the sales agreement admin report with data based on firm orgs. We added a dropdown for the Selling Org and the Firm Orgs in the Sales Agreement admin report. The report can be filtered on a Selling Org and/or Firm Orgs to easily determine which products are on/off, which is especially helpful for the Firm Orgs (sub firms). The new column has been added to the CSV format of the report.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>A new column "Firm Org" is added to Sales Agreement report based on the filter selection. The change is applied to the CSV format of the report.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Set Content Type When Writing to Azure Blob Storage: EAES-4045</b>
        </p>
        <p>For malware scanning to work properly, we updated the writing of blobs in FireLight to set the content type as appropriate.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Sunset Legacy Forms Phase I UI: PC-2574</b>
        </p>
        <p>FireLight has gone through several iterations and user interfaces. Currently we have two versions of the user interface available to the market, the "Legacy UI" and the "Forms and Wizard UI." We will begin the process of sunsetting the "Legacy UI" by updating the default view option for “Lock Mode” to Wizards and Forms vs the Legacy UI view.    This change will not be applied by default to the data entry mode at this time.   We will be working with our current Legacy UI clients to determine the best path forward to get them all moved to the Wizard and Forms UI.  The "Legacy UI" only supported Forms and requires at least one form to be present in a package. The "Forms and Wizard UI" allows for any combination of Forms and Wizards and does not require a form to be present in a package to work correctly. Unless the organization had configured a Lock mode of Forms and Wizards, their agents would have seen the legacy UI after lockdown.  In that case, agents will now see the Forms and Wizard UI after lockdown.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>No action is required to use the "Forms and Wizard UI." Clients who had been using the legacy UI will experience moderate changes to the user experience in Lock Mode.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Create Pages from Source Wizard to Destination Wizard While Copying: DIST-3552</b>
        </p>
        <p>This is an enhancement to the existing feature to copy fields from a source wizard to a destination wizard. Users will now be able to also create and copy pages to the destination wizard while copying fields. They can choose to copy selected fields on the active page or create new pages from source wizard and copy fields on them.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>A new option to also copy pages will is added on Copy Wizard Fields dialog on Wizard Designer</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">After Signing External Request, Reviewer Is No Longer Able to Use the Link to Access the Documents: EAES-3581</b>
        </p>
        <p>We resolved an issue where users were unable to access application PDFs after signing when entering passcodes. Access of application PDFs now works as expected.</p>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Identify Large Rules and Inform Admin Tool Users: EAES-3392</b>
        </p>
        <p>Very Large Rules/ Rulesets can hinder system performance and are difficult to debug.   Logic has been added to the system to identify large rules (Size &gt; 1MB) when created and warn the administration user when they are saving a large rule.  In addition, the rule size will be tracked and displayed within the rules window.</p>
        <p><b>Impact</b>
        </p>
        <p>FireLight Admin Tool</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Soft Limit Addendums Should Inherit the Same Protection Levels as the Source Form: EAES-4237</b>
        </p>
        <p>The content type should be set when writing to blob storage (documents, forms, wizard/form/ruleset definitions, etc.) for malware scanning to work properly.  We have updated all writing of blobs in FireLight to set the content type as appropriate.</p>

        <p><b>Review Queue REST API Permissions Vulnerability Due to Not Using Token Organization: EAES-4011</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Review Queue REST APIs accepted the org CarrierCode on the request and did not validate that the caller has the necessary permissions to access that organization’s data.

        </p>
