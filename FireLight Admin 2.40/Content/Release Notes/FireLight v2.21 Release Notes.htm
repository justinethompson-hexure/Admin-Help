Assistive technology is also negatively impacted as a result of web content that does not conform to defined accessibility guidelines. There are three levels of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliance: A, AA and AAA. The levels of accessibility are broken down into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust (POUR). Enhancements are needed for FireLight to complete compliance for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for Level A and AA. Enhancements to FireLight will continue; pursuing the desired goal of accessibility Level AA.</p>

A new undelivered email template is created to notify agents of emails that remain undelivered during the nightly schedule. This template will loop through all activities and notify the agent in one email of all emails that remain undelivered. Additionally, for FireLight system sent emails, FireLight will send a nightly batch report to a specified endpoint. </p>

This is an available option for only DocuSign Remote Signature.</p>
                <p>Assumptions to consider with this project:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>DocuSign must be honored anytime it is enabled regardless of the Org initiating the application.  Meaning, Carriers enable DocuSign and deploy the app to the distribution.  FireLight must honor DocuSign for the distribution as well as honor it in the carrier Org.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>DocuSign will support Remote Sign Only.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FireLight is handing off the signing process for remote sign when DocuSign is enabled. Any Email notification, Signing and audit is completed within the DocuSign environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When DocuSign is enabled, the Signature Audit will not be captured within the FireLight Signing audit, however FireLight is receiving a signature audit back from DocuSign that is attached to the application and sent within the client's payload.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FireLight will need the signed documents with the digital signature applied and the DocuSign signature audit returned 100% complete to FireLight.  The clients that need DocuSign implemented have the DocuSign digital signature, tamper evidence and audit approved.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FireLight must be able to retain the digital signature without breaking the hash for the DocuSign documents.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FireLight must be able to send documents completed by DocuSign to the different firms (Distributor receive X&amp;Y forms and Carrier receives A, B, and C).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FL will need a bi-directional ability to cancel the eSignature (A user can cancel the signature from FireLight and from DocuSign).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The User MUST have authentication when sending PII information to DocuSign, so FireLight will still send the last 4 digits of the SSN and DOB of each party to DocuSign, as well as sending the signer's mobile phone number to initiate SMS Text Verification through DocuSign. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clients wanting to use the DocuSign service from an organization level will need to contact Hexure in order to enable the service.</p>

Create an attribute or element on the node that is configurable to call on the callasyncaction rule node. This would allow a save to happen on both initiation and completion of the async call to a provider. If this attribute is set, 1) a permanent save of the activity data (from the current data session) is performed before initiating the async action, and 2) when the async action completes, the pending data is updated in the saved app data, so that if the user never performs any more data entry in the session, the updated values from the async action is persisted with the activity.  If the user does continue data entry, it will still check for pending changes and update the current session values (like it does today) so that if the user saves the activity later on, it will include any pending data and their latest data entry inputs. </p>
                <p>This enhancement supports allowing the provider to trigger a save prior to a call and after a call is completed (i.e., Milliman). The benefit of this enhancement is, if a user exits the session without saving the data needed for a web service call, we will have already saved the data and it can be retrieved. The same is true if the user exits after the call is complete but does not  save, the data from the call is stored. Implementing this enhancement will eliminate a compliance risk. </p>

For example, present a final checkbox once the app is 100%. Today, to do this technically you cannot be 100% because once all data is entered, a new requirement is presented which means the app is no longer at 100%. The old consumer portal had this logic where the final acknowledgement and the next button would not show until the previous screen was 100%. </p>
                <p>This enhancement will add the ability for the admin to configure a workflow separator between wizard screens that must be clear of all errors before the user can proceed. This enhancement will eliminate the need to control the workflow via rules which is not smooth and error prone. From a UI perspective, when the separator is added, the wizard workflow will hide the Next button and grey out the screen navigation until all the errors on the previous screen are corrected. There are many use cases for this. One common use case is for agent attestation prior to continuing to signing. </p>

Problem: The issue with fields still visible after lock-down was due to iConnect 194752 "Exclude from PDF fields show as enabled when app is locked."  That change caused Exclude From PDF fields to no longer be displayed in the app user interface for a locked activity.  Labels with Exclude From PDF are being used to cover other fields that are not excluded from the PDF, so the fields on the PDF were no longer being covered by the label. Resolution: It was determined that the original bug fix was incorrect -- the Exclude from PDF option should apply only to the actual PDF, and not display of the form in the UI after lock down.  The code changes for iConnect 194752 were rolled back. The issue with sign later not being displayed was resolved by updating the AFA branding, which was previously hiding the sign later option, but no longer is, but the branding in UATNext was using an older version and hiding the option.  This has been resolved by updating the AFA branding.  The SMS text part of this iConnect is a forms issue and not a base issue.</MadCap:change>

Changeset 48194 for iConnect 224368 in the 2.21 branch sets the doctype to NeedsDetermination for documents fed over from a needs activity, which is part of the solution for this.  However, it still doesn't operate as a template in the child because the document tag is also being set to NeedsDetermination (for all documents from the original activity).  This is incorrect, because a) there must be only one template document with a given doc tag in an activity, and b) the client wants to use the same document tags in the pre-sale and application to identify these documents. Resolution: Modify the base system to still pass through the original document tag, allowing a) each document to be distinguishable and support operating as a template document upload, and b) organizations to configure their template document types for their needs. NOTE: This only addresses template documents coming from a pre-sale or illustration.  Additional changes would be required to support traditional templates documents (doctype AdditionalDocWithSignature) being fed over other activity types and functioning as uploaded templates in the child activity.  It is unknown whether this is desired/needed and what impacts it could have.<br />Areas Impacted: Uploaded documents from a pre-sale or illustration into the next activity.</p>

Problem: Auto-Decline Pre-Signature Review was added for fixing bugs 20051 and 20238. The logic for calling this was added for Edit Application, but not for Edit Wizard Application. The client's app used Edit Wizard Application, so the app skipped over Pre-Signature Review without auto-declining it. Storing the signature was failing because the app was still in the Pending Approval state, waiting for approval or decline of the Pre-Signature Review.
