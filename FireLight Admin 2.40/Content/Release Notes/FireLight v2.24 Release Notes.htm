                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 255104 </b> FL Illustrations Base gender mapping incorrect for life products. Problem: The gender is not mapping correctly for illustration and sets to female each time. Resolution: The gender for annuitant and insured is mapped over for illustration using the description of Male/Female or the int values 1 or 2.  The export value used in this case was M/F and was not recognized and would always default to female.  Added the values for M/F to allow it to map correctly. <br />Areas Impacted: Gender set for annuitant and insured for illustration</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 257859 </b> Application Submitted without Client Signature. Problem: The request to Decline Review was not validating to verify the activity was in the correct state and included and auto submit step that submitted the activity before all signatures were complete. Resolution: Added validation to the both the Accept and Decline requests to verify the activity can be reviewed. This will prevent an activity getting incorrect audits and getting submitted before it should. <br />Areas Impacted: This would affect clients using Pre and Post Signature Review. NOTE: this problem only occurs if the user opened an activity in multiple windows (sessions), where one session unlocks the activity while the other session declines review.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 258395 </b> NWL carrier is not showing unless "All" is selected from Product Type. Problem: The list of products (and based on that, the list of carriers) could be incomplete when the product type was Select Product Type. Resolution: When the product type selection is Select Product Type, do not populate the list of product types based on the default product type, which can result in a partial list of products, and instead display an empty list of products. Also change the default Product Type in Preferences to be All rather than Life, and add Select Product Type to the drop-down so if that is the current selection, it will show that (and to allow the default selection to be changed back to Select Product Type). Additionally, the reason that NWL carrier displays first in the list of carriers is because the organization name is prefixed with a space character—modified the carrier list for the new app workflow to trim spaces from the beginning of the organization name so that it is sorted alphabetically if prefixed with space characters. <br />Areas Impacted: Default Product Type selection and list of available products shown during new application workflow</p>

Problem:  The ready for agent sign email was not being sent. Resolution:  The option for agent ready for sign was moved to the group options and was using the session state to check for the group options.  These are not set for external signature requests.  The agent ready for signing should use the activity's owning agent group options to determine whether to send the agent a ready for signing email after the last external signer has completed. <br />Areas Impacted: Agent signatures when the group option for notify agent when ready for signing and agent sign last are set in the Admin group options</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260014 </b> Copy activity logic and data item properties. Problem: On a copy with changes it appears the visibility and enable rules are retaining on tags even when there are no visibility rules that exist in the tags on a new product. Resolution: Modified the copy with changes logic to set all data items IsEnabled = true, IsVisible = true, IsReadonly = false. Modified the combined wizard+forms UI to also set Visible and Enabled to true prior to initializing the rules engine (only set IsReadonly to false on copy with changes, so that legacy behavior will not be affected, and due to the fact that data items can be locked on a next activity). <br />Areas Impacted: Copy with changes, default visibility and enabled state of data items prior to running rules</p>

Problem: The changes for iConnect 254568 introduced this bug, and the data items were being updated in the app only if also locking transferred data items. Resolution: Corrected the logic to always update the data items in the app, but set them to "read only" only if Lock Transferred Data Items is checked on the activity. <br />Areas Impacted: Update of app from illustration</p>

Problem: In the May release, with enhancements for TFS 29286 -- (256841) Support Display of Wizards in UI after Lockdown, the wizard UI is now used after lockdown. There was a bug in the wizard implementation of the continue/apply functionality that was preventing the next activity logic from happening.

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 257186 </b> Performance: Admin - slow loading of Groups profile. Problem: As per finding the performance issue on the groups profile page, we found that while loading the groups page on the UI, there is a function i.e. GetTrainingModel() to fetch all training videos. Under this function, there is an API call to Vimeo, which gets all videos and saves them into cache. The first time it takes time to call the API and after that it always fetches from the cache. Resolution: After understanding the vimeo API documentation, we found some more filters to get accurate data with fewer recursive calls. Before my changes, when API calls were made, it was found that there were 352 videos and the API picked only 25 videos at a time. To retrieve all of the data, the API was called 15 times. We found some more filters, i.e. per_page, query_fields, and query, to get only required videos and it calls the API once only. By using this concept, it improves the performance. <br />Areas Impacted: Groups profile</p>

Problem: Changes for TFS 29240 -- Remove Benchmarks introduced two issues: 1) It caused all apps created within the FireLight UI (not via SSO) to always have the TestIndicator flag set.  This has the side effect of backend processing for most providers to skip the DTCC transmission step. 2) It caused all apps created within the FL UI to always have the EnableRecordMode flag set.  This caused unnecessary overhead during app initialization. Resolution: 1) Reverted the EnableTestMode group flag to be honored correctly (setting TestIndicator only if Enable Test Mode group option is enabled.  This option has nothing to do with the benchmarking feature. 2) Ensured that all logic tied to group options EnableViewTestCases and EnableRecordMode to disabled / no longer honored and treated as unchecked.

Problem: The reminder emails, which always originate from the scheduler, have never supported branding with the company logo, because the scheduler does not have access to the logos, which are only defined in EGApp.  This is a long-standing limitation of emails from the scheduler. With the 2.23 release, apps processed in a workflow (for instance, submit, but there are several other workflows as well) which fail on the first attempt are now retried in the scheduler (this is intentional, in preparation for the cloud.  On the retry, if any emails are sent during the workflow processing from the scheduler (for instance, final emails on activity completion), and if the org is using their company logo in an HTML email template, the email will not include the company logo. Since this could impact emails that previously would correctly include the branded logo, the existing limitation should be removed, so that emails originating from the scheduler will properly include the company logo.  This will also address the reported issue of reminder emails not including the company logo. Resolution: Modified the scheduler to locate and use the branding images in EGApp. <br />Areas Impacted: Branded emails with company logo originating from scheduler (reminders, final emails, etc.)</p>

Problem: Two different scenarios have been identified where the From name in an email out of FireLight can incorrectly display as the organization email address or no-reply@firelighteapp.com. 1) When possible, the From name &amp; email address are based on the owning agent's login information, but there are several factors that can result in that not being used: a) The group option Enable Use Agent Email must be checked. b) The user preference option Use Agent Email for All Communications must be checked. c) The agent must have a name passed in their SSO or configured in preferences. If any of those are not the case, the organization email address is used as the final fallback for the From address &amp; name (and the default organization email address is no-reply@firelighteapp.com), and also for the AGENT_NAME email template variable.  Instead of using the organization email address for the From name, it should instead use the organization name for this fallback. 2) Even with the previous corrected, there is another scenario where the From name of the email message will not be specified and is shown as fl-noreply@firelighteapp.com, if the organization does not have Use DMARC configured in org settings. In addition, the system does not set the To name of any email messages, only the To address.  This is less noticeable, because many email clients will show the receiving user's name even though it isn't in the mail headers, but this should also be fixed. Resolution: 1) Default the From name in emails to the organization name instead of org email as a final fallback when not using the agent name due to group, preference, and user settings. 2) Ensure that the From name in the email From information is always using the From Name associated with the email message. 3) Trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the From address since it can prevent sending of messages. 4) Check for null or whitespace instead of null or empty when determining the email address and name values to use for an email message. <br />Areas Impacted: All emails</p>

The system should never default to the organization email address for the To address of a mail message. Resolution: Modified the decline message to not use the org email address as the To address if the agent email address it not available due to group options, user preferences, or user email information. NOTE:&#160;This will prevent the email from being sent to the org email address (typically fl-norepy@firelighteapp.com), but the notification cannot be sent if no email address is available due to 1) Enable Use Agent Email being disabled in groups settings, or 2) Use Agent Email for All Communications being disabled in user preferences, or 3) the agent not having an email address configured.  Either the agent email should be provided in their SSO, or the agent's group code should be configured to allow the agent to set their email address in preferences, if the notification is desired.<br />Areas Impacted: Decline E-Signature notification email</p>

When generating the PDF, FireLight first stamps labels, then other form fields, and the ones stamped last "win" and is the top-most controls and therefore will display over labels. Resolution: I discovered that if the labels are stamped after the form fields, the labels is top-most and cover other fields at the same position.

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260043 </b> JKL Auto-submit - Not submitting when it should have. Problem: If a client was in the middle of the signing ceremony (externally, for example), and the agent completed their signature, and then afterward the client finished their signature, auto-submit would not work - this is because we were using the external eSign model's data for signature completion detection, which was out of date (because the agent had finished their signature). Resolution: Added some logic that pulls signature completion data from the database in order to detect signature completion, which tells the system accurately whether to auto-submit or not. <br />Areas Impacted: Legacy/non-react eSign - encompasses signature completion and the page that shows signatures, but mostly signature completion detection. Impact should be minimal, but all eSign routes through the changed code.</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 258683</b> Continue button disabled after async call and app is 100% complete. Problem: After an asyncaction rule executes and the app gets to 100% complete, the Continue button is not enabled unless the application is reopened.  The UI disables continue if the app display status is PendingResponse (1600).  After the async rule completes, the application display status is updated to responseReceived (1610), but the session model app is not updated to reflect this change, so the Continue button remains disabled. Resolution: When pending data is received from the async rule, update the session model app display status from the database so that the Continue button will become enabled as soon as all other conditions (such as 100% complete) are met. NOTE: Moved the bug reported in FPS-3299 into a separate iConnect 262149 since it is a different issue.<br />Areas Impacted: Continue button enabled state after async action completes in wizard and legacy forms UI</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260642 </b> Wizard/embedded - Error loading activity with form label having URL containing unescaped XML characters. Problem: There is a base bug in the wizard UI which is resulting in this problem.  The client has a form  with a label having a URL. The bug is that the wizard UI (and embedded) tries to parse that string as XML (to extract the URL), which fails to parse due to the raw ampersand character, resulting in an exception and preventing the UI from loading (and for embedded, the error in InitSessionModel). Resolution: Modified the code to use regex to extract the URL instead of attempting to parse as XML. <br />Areas Impacted: Forms with labels having URLs, in the combined forms+wizard UI</p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">DR 260899 </b> Wizard - Hidden fields included in tab order. Problem: Wizard forms were getting undesirable and unnecessary tab-stops. Resolution: 1) Text fields have had their tab-stopping removed, as there is no user interaction for users on these fields, and blank text is often used for spacing, etc., which would still have been tab-stopped. 2) There was an issue when tabbing off fields with validation popups, as the system would tab stop into the error message, then the error message would immediately be closed, effectively requiring two tabs to move to the next field. Both of these issues have been addressed. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizards, Embedded ESign</p>
