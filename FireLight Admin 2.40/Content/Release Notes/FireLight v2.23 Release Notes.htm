                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;256959 </b> Template form Popup not showing in legacy forms UI if localized text contains single quotes. Problem:&#160;Some text values in the HTML were surrounded by single quotes. Those quotes were conflicting with quotes within the text itself and causing invalid HTML. Resolution: Changed the single quotes surrounding the text to double quotes to avoid the conflicts. <br></br>Areas Impacted: These changes only affect Non wizard Activities in Data Entry. Some clients may not be affected if they did not have quotes in the custom messages listed below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;257182 </b> Apps not being transmitted due to properties not reflecting latest application state. Problem: The auto save logic had a bug where upon copying a case the hasValidSignatures flag and the hasErrors flag could be improperly set. Resolution: Jayson B's changes seem to have fixed the hasValidSigantures bug in this iConnect. Tested a submitted app and everything seems to be consistent.<br></br>Areas Impacted:&#160;All activity transmissions</p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257467 </b> Application Creation is out of SLA. Problem: The common tag feature added an overhead to the creation of the activity data items collection since it needs to through all fields in the activity. Resolution: Added database caching when loading the forms/wizards, when we build the activity data items collection. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Building the activity data items collection when creating an activity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257624 </b> Apps getting 'stuck' after pre-submit review. Problem: This problem applies when an application has Pre-Signature Review enabled in its activity, and FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW is set to false. If the agent browses back to the application editing page while waiting on signatures to complete, then the process for automatically declining Pre-Signature Review will occur, which will put the app into a state that causes the continue button to get stuck. This seems to be the most common when an agent sends a email request for signing and then completes the agent signing section, then browses back to the application. Resolution: Added check on the application status for automatically declining Pre-Signature Review so the process occurs when locking, not again after locking. This automatic declining of Pre-Signature Review now will only occur if the application status is in a "ActiveApplication" (0) state or a "PendingReview" (7) state, and occurs for Wizards when locking, and Forms when continuing from the Edit Application page. There isn't a way to check if Pre-Signature Review has already been declined so checking to see if we are in the correct state to auto-decline Pre-Signature Review is difficult. This also means that there are a lot of different ways this fix can be tested.<br></br>Areas Impacted: Applications that use Pre-Signature Review and have FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW set to false</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257669 </b> Unable to Get Past Signatures Complete. Problem: Not able to continue to review step after signing. Resolution: Removed the condition causing the continue button to not enable when you are not able to save as it does not need to save again before moving to review.  Moved logic for disable save. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Continue button enable logic</p>
            </li>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257775, 257784 </b> Producer name no longer flooding to application. Problem: With the recent common tag implementation, the provider data item initialization was not adding data items if they didn't exist, and it was only updating them. Resolution: Fixed the provider implementation to add the data item if it doesn't exist. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Provider data items initialization</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 258115 </b> Sporadic occurrences of submitted applications not completing. </p>
                <p>Problem (TFS 26998):  Occasionally, an application is submitted, is processed in the BeforeOSJ workflow, but then does not go through the Submit workflow, leaving the status at Submit Requested. Analysis of an occurrence found that the BeforeOSJ workflow completed, deleting of the workflow record timed out, which prevented the Submit workflow from being initiated, resulting in the above behavior. Resolution: Modify the workflow processing to ensure the Submit workflow is always initiated when the BeforeOSJ workflow processing finishes. </p>
                <p>Problem (TFS 29232): When inserting into the workflow via StartWorkflow, if a WorkflowInstance record already exists for that app, it just updates the workflow, but does not update the WorkflowType.  So if, for instance, a SendAppStatus workflow was initiated but failed, it would remain in the workflow, and if another workflow (for instance SubmitAfterOSJ) was started, it would remain as a 'SendAppStatus' workflow and the SubmitAfterOSJ workflow would never occur. Some workflow types are more important than others. If a SubmitAfterOSJ workflow was started, but remained due to a failure, a SendAppStatus workflow should not replace it in the workflow (but the reverse should).  Resolution: Modify UpdateWorkflow to update the WorkflowType for workflows other than status workflows. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Submission of applications</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 258189 </b> Duplicate signatures on addendums triggered in the application. Problem: Signature of the same signer are duplicated on the addendum document.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;258638 </b> Address Autocomplete field not working correctly. Problem: The state mapping was determining the state code type (Acord vs. abbrev vs. state) from the list values, but if the first list value was empty, this wasn't working, preventing the mapping from occurring. Resolution: Exclude empty list values for determining the state type when mapping in address auto complete, CRM, etc. <br></br>Areas Impacted: State code mapping when mapping fields in address autocomplete and CRM</p>
            </li>

Problem: With the recent Common Tag feature implementation the FLI_PERCENT_COMPLETE changes were not committed to the Rules correctly.

Problem: In the wizard designer, custom lists were being identified by Guid (internal ID) rather than name.  So if a wizard was exported and imported into another organization, an error would occur in data entry for the app because the custom list could not be loaded (even if the referenced custom was added for that org, because it would have a different ID). Resolution: With the fix, it now also stores the custom list name in the wizard definition, and then looks up the custom list (for that org) by name, so the above scenario will now work (if the org has that custom list defined). <br></br>Areas Impacted: Wizard designer Data Grid and Custom Lists</p>

Problem: This is a data issue related to iConnect 250011 - in that iConnect ticket, we changed the internal queue IDs of all PreSubmit queues to match a specific pattern, and then modified the code to use that pattern to determine if a queue is a PreSubmit queue. A number of database syncs across multiple organizations have taken place since the corresponding sql script has been run, and so have overwritten the new PreSubmit queue ID pattern with the old IDs, and now the new code is no longer able to tell if a queue is PreSubmit, which ultimately leads to problems with the PreSubmit review step for any affected organization. Resolution: All these syncs are coming from the UAT databases. It has been determined that we will not be updating those databases (which would prevent the syncs from changing the PreSubmit queue IDs). So, anytime a sync occurs, this problem will come back for the given organization, and we will need to re-run the corresponding script for that organization.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DRs 258021, 258028 </b> Slow data entry in legacy forms UI. Problem: Changes related to common tags work introduced additional overhead of duplicating data collections when getting data items during data entry.  In legacy forms, the process to fix invalid combos incurred this overhead for every field in the activity, severely slowing field updates. Resolution: Eliminated the data collection duplication. <br></br>Areas Impacted: This impacts all data entry in FireLight, and could improve load time (for legacy forms and combined wizard + forms UI) as well as updating of fields and other data entry workflows</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DRs 258151, 258310 </b> Weird Behavior with the Tables in Distributor Instances. Problem: This behavior was a side effect of two bugs. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>There is logic in the wizard UI to load custom lists for the activity, but it loads only the app organization's custom lists, so in a distributor organization, the carrier's custom lists were not getting loaded (originally reported in iConnect 208198, but never fixed).  The system compares the timestamp of the custom list with the associated grid information to determine if the grid data needs to be updated due to a list change, but because this list of custom lists doesn't include the carrier's, it always treats the grid data as out-of-date and proceeds to #2. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Elsewhere, there is logic in the wizard UI (implemented for iConnect 223527) to "Update the list definition for a grid without (read: attempting not to) replacing user entries."  This logic a) doesn't rely on the custom lists loaded in #1, b) assumes that there is a unique key column for the custom list data (which there isn't for custom list System SubAccounts, associated with grid field Allocation_Data_Grid) and c) apparently does replace user entries in some cases.  Because of issue #1, this replacement logic always executes when opening an activity in the distributor environment, which has the effect of assigning values from one row to other rows of the grid with the same ProductId, which results in the allocation values getting duplicated. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Modified the wizard logic in a distributor environment to also load the carrier's custom lists for the logic to determine if the grid data is out-of-date.  So if the custom list hasn't changed, it will no longer proceed to #2. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the custom list has changed, modified the wizard logic to update the grid list definition only if the column that has been identified as the key column has unique values for each row of the list.  Note that this could still result in the original bug reported in 223527 manifesting in some scenarios (if a custom list not having a unique key column is updated, in-flight apps' grid data associated with that custom list will not get updated).  And apparently the fix for 223527 is incomplete in that it does sometimes replace user entries, and that issue still exists, but will not occur in this scenario.  A more comprehensive review of the original bug and fix would be needed to completely avoid this possibility. </p>
