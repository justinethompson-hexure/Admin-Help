            <li>
                <p>Added more details to the "Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline" option in Organization Settings on the Signature tab as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline</b> – Select the checkbox to allow activities to be submitted when electronic signature is declined. This setting uses the carrier setting to override the distributor setting. FireLight looks at the setting of the two organizations. If the distributor has it cleared (unchecked) so that they do not receive submissions when e-signature is declined, but the carrier has the option selected (checked), the carrier still receives the transmission, but the distributor does not. </p>
                <p>For distributors that want to review applications that were declined from e-signature (FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN), you can enable Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline in Organization Settings on the Signature tab.  Or, if you do not want apps that were declined e-signature to be transmitted to carriers that do have Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline enabled, the distributor will need to work with each carrier to have the carrier provider modified to not transmit the application.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN is what is set when the agent clicks decline e-sign.  It is also a common tag value that can be set via rules if the client wants to decline e-signature based on something in the app. And, if the firm does not support e-signature at all, they set that with the organization setting for the logged in org.  Since you can use rules to set that value, the carrier could set it via rules, but if the carrier sets that value globally, all orders will skip the e-sign selection screen and decline e-sign.  “Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline” is a different setting.  That means, send me the data even if they do not e-sign and the FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN is true.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Added more details to the "Address Validation" topic in the Features section of Admin Help including two Lob.com helpful links and a note that, "Only the Production environment uses the live instance. Our LOB.com account has a key and endpoint defined for a test region and a live region. Production is the only environment that uses the live environment."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Added links from Admin Help to several user guide topics.</p>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 203748</b> (Carriers and Distributors) Add Placeholder Text to Form/Wizard Field Properties. Placeholder text is added to the Text and Wizard Field Properties in the Designer for Forms and Wizards in the Admin tool. This allows clients to add in verbiage that could be displayed within a field. For example, if I had Owner_FirstName on a form I could add "First Name" in this property. During the app process a user can then see "First Name" displayed in the field prior to clicking/tabbing into it. Adding an area on the form field properties for the user to enter "Display Text" will allow for text to be displayed in forms for ease of use and eliminate the need for adding labels if helper text is necessary.</p>
                <p>The Form Designer has also been updated to further align with the Wizard Designer. "Tool Tip" was changed to "Help Text" so both designers use the same terminology to enhance user experience.</p>
                <p>Impacts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Form Designer - New option for Placeholder Text, change of "Tool Tip" to "Help Text" to align with Wizard Designer terminology</li>
                    <li>Wizard Designer - New option for Placeholder Text</li>
                    <li>Masks - Do not anticipate impact, but will want to test through masks because a change to the mask control was made. Potential impact could be a different text color for placeholder or mask.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 215154 </b> (Carriers and Distributors: Admin Users) The set control state node has a script attribute that indicates that the value should be cleared on disabled.  With the requested change, we will implement the same logic in the VisibilityNode.cs. </p>
                <p>Impacts:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li> This provides a way for  the rule author to write a rule that could clear the values of the children of the panel when the panel is hidden.</li>

                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 228850</b> (Carriers and Distributors) Update Pop Up Message for base callouts. Generic, user friendly wording is needed for system messages when actions are running in the background.  The message that displays today is not user friendly and confusing to a client or agent.  For scenarios when the action is not specifically defined, present a generic message that says:  “A validation is being performed.” There is a spinner that pops up on the screen that indicates a process is running so we don’t need the message to say “in the background.”</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Generic message: "A validation is being performed."</li>

                    <li>If Lexis Nexis, display this specific message: "User validation is being performed."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Impacts:</p>

            <li>
                <p>FireLight Base: Added a new common tag FLI_ACTIVITY_NAME.  This dataitem contains activity name. It can be used in a rule to look for an activity by name.</p>

                <b class="DRnumber">CMR 202995, 147651, 170517 </b>  (Carriers: Admin Users) Deployments are very slow to load and process.  For carriers that have a lot of distribution and products, deployments can take up to 10 minutes just to load the screen to select a single product to deploy.  Enhancements have been made to support preselection of Syncronization scope and the addition of an Organization filter and a button to select loading the deployment information.  These small changes will prevent FireLight from preloading all of the changes for all distribution which often is not the desire.  These changes will speed up the load time.<p>Impacts:</p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Admin Deployment History View</li><li>A new Filter Option appears for the Organization</li><li>A new button called  "Load Deployment Information" is next to the Organization filter</li><li> Loading of products will not occur until the preselections are made and the user specifically selects the "Load Deployment Information"</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 215635</b> (Carriers) Custom Lists to be deployed in All Configuration scope. Carriers are using custom lists in combination with rules in FireLight to control allocations as it gives greater flexibility to manage distributor variations and date drive changes. Custom lists are not included in the "All Configuration" deployment, which has led to production issues because distributors didn't deploy the lists. There are some carriers who intentionally do not deploy all custom lists to all distributors. In order to fulfill the request to include the custom list in "All Configuration" deployment, but allow for carriers to have the flexibility to decide if they would like to include custom lists with a product, a change is made to "Sales Agreements." The "Sales Agreements" details will feature a sub tab for packages and custom lists. Packages is displayed as they are currently, but moved to display under a sub tab labeled "Packages." A new sub tab is created for "Custom Lists." The custom list(s) desired to be added to the product is available for selection under the "Custom Lists" sub tab.</p>

            <li>
                <b class="DRnumber">CMR 235019 </b>  (Carriers: E-Delivery Clients) E-Delivery is enhanced to support new workflows for Signing Only and Deliver Only.  This release focuses on Deliver Only - Client Directed; Deliver Only - Agent Directed; and Sign Only - Client Directed. <p>Both of these workflows will enter FireLight as locked cases and will not allow edits or Request Change. For these workflows, the agent or client will have a different option called Request Print that will allow the client to request a printed version.  Selecting this option will generate an 1122 to the carrier indicating the status of RequestPrint.</p><p> - Deliver Only child cases is marked complete as soon as the child authenticates and is presented the option to review and download. The parent case is marked complete when all of the child cases are marked complete.</p><p>-  Sign Only cases are intended to support documents that only need a signature.  These child cases is marked complete as soon as each of the child cases complete their signing.  Each signer will have the option to download and receive an email with the link to login and download.</p><p>E-Delivery Impacts:</p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><p>These new workflows is supported in the 121 with subtypes 12122 for Sign Only and 12123 for Deliver Only.

                    <b class="DRnumber">SendGrid</b> (Carriers and Distributors) As part of the 2.18 release, we introduced a new feature that would allow us to use a third-party service called SendGrid to send outbound email.  The goal of this project is to improve our email delivery to Google and other large email providers, to improve visibility into email delivery, and to possibly leverage additional services provided by SendGrid to enhance the overall email validation and tracking within FireLight.  The feature was delivered in 2.18, but it was disabled with the release.  We have been using SendGrid in our Dev and QE environment without any issues. Our plan is to enable SendGrid in UAT on October 30th. We will do this around 7 pm when we are doing our integration deployments.  Your users should see no additional downtime during this time.  We plan on testing SendGrid in UAT. The move to production is still to be determined and may be before the April release.   </p>

                    <b class="DRnumber">CMR 204558</b> (Carriers and Distributors) Email: Download All Forms. Once an application is complete, and an email is sent out to the client to view or download their PDFs for their records, they are presented with the screen to either view or download individual PDFs from their application.  This forces the user to either view or download, and not do both at the same time. It also only allows individual download, which can take some time to do.</p>
                <p>With this enhancement, the View and Download panes is combined to allow the user to both view and download at the same time.  We will also add a "View/Download All PDFs" so the user can select one button and either view or download the application for their records.  The individual PDFs listed will still stay if the user only wants to view/download one PDF at a time.</p>
                <p>When a document is viewed and/or downloaded, an open tab will also show the names of the PDFs to allow for greater detail in what a user is reviewing.</p>

In Development - This is a multi-release item and it will not be production ready in Dec. This enhancement will take the existing E-Signature process that is currently in place, and make it available within the React system.  This will allow a user to be able to move through the E-Signature process outside of our current Legacy system.  This is a phased approach, the majority of the current functionality will still be available, eventually allowing all of our functionality to work within React.</p>
                <p>In this release, we is focusing on the Client API, specifically utilizing the Sign Now functionality.  This enhancement will allow embedded clients to enter into the E-Signature ceremony to complete the signing process for their parties.  This enhancement will impact the Initialization page, Client Consent Capture, Presentation of Required Signers and Completed Signatures, and the Sign Now functionality, which will include Document Sets, Initials, and capturing a Signature.  This enhancement will not include the SMS text Functionality, LexisNexis, Topaz Functionality, or Driver License Verification.</p>
                <p>While this enhancement will impact the full Sign Now functionality of the E-Signature process, it will not impact the existing Legacy feature, meaning this is only impacting Embedded clients at this time.</p>
