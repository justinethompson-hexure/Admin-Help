        <p>The review process begins in a queue.</p>
        <p>Following is a typical post-submission workflow for reviewing orders within a queue for submission to the back office for processing.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The reviewer selects an order from one of the queues.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The reviewer clicks the <b class="Bold">Review</b> button and sets the order status to “Locked” so other reviewers cannot access the order while it is in review.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE: </b>If the initial reviewer cannot complete the review process, the reviewer clicks the <b class="Bold">Unlock</b> button to make the order available for other reviewers to continue the review process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the organization has a review Deadline Length, the order shows an expiration date in the queue. If the order is not reviewed before the deadline expiration date and time, FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> approves or rejects the order from the review queue depending on the organization’s review deadline settings. If the order is rejected, the agent needs to go into FireLight to review and determine if the order is still suitable, then copy the rejected activity, make necessary changes, and resubmit the order.</p>
                <p>The order displays an Expires date when a deadline is set for a review queue. This text turns red when two or fewer business days remain for the review deadline.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the organization has the Enable Manual Queue Move option enabled in FireLight Admin, the reviewer can move an order to another review queue. The reviewer selects another queue in the list of queues and clicks the <b class="Bold">Move</b> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The reviewer opens and reviews the order documents and history by clicking the <b class="Bold">Application PDF</b>, <b class="Bold">Application History</b>, <b class="Bold">Queue History</b>, <b class="Bold">Needs Determination</b> (if available), supplemental application documents (<b class="Bold">Illustration</b>, etc.), and <b class="Bold">Audit Report</b> links. The reviewer can also click <b class="Bold">Attach Documents</b> to add documents to the order.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If needed, the reviewer requests more information from the agent for the order by clicking the <b class="Bold">More Info</b> button and then proceeding with the written request. The order status changes from “Locked” to “Request Sent. Pending Reply”.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The organization determines whether to include reviewer documents in the order package and whether reviewer documents are optional or required. If the organization requires reviewer documents, FireLight disables the Approve button until after the reviewer completes the required reviewer documents. When reviewer documents are optional, the Approve button remains enabled.</p>
                <p>If the order package includes reviewer documents, the reviewer clicks <b class="Bold">Reviewer Documents</b>, fills in the applicable fields on each reviewer document, and clicks a button to <b class="Bold">Save</b> or <b class="Bold">Complete</b> (lock) the reviewer document. The reviewer clicks <b class="Bold">Back to Review Queue</b> to return to the order review.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> When using Sequential Review Queues, FireLight retains the reviewer documents and reviewer comments in the original queue. However, since each queue has a brand new document set, FireLight does not retain these comments across sequential review queues. Despite this, these comments can be copied through a client's provider. If interested in this option, the organization can reach out to the Strategic Account Manager.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After reviewing all of the information available for the order, the reviewer approves or rejects the order by clicking the applicable <b class="Bold">Approve</b> or <b class="Bold">Reject</b> button.</p>
            </li>
