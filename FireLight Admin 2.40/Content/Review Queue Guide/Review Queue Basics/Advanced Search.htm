                <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> The available advanced search options vary by organization. For example, if the Tele-Sign feature is enabled in FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> for an organization, the Advanced Search dialog includes the Tele-Sign App ID.</p>
                <p>The search options available in the Queues section are different from the search options in the History and Reviewers sections.</p>
                <p><b class="Bold">Example – Queues section: searching by user</b>
                </p>
                <p>The reviewer selects the applicable search options:</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b class="Bold">User</b> list includes the Review Queue users that  currently have a login active and have access to that review queue. "All Users" is the default user in the list. Select a user in the list to search for cases reviewed by that user. The Advanced Search filters by the reviewer, showing all cases the reviewer has locked but may not be currently locked by the reviewer. If the History shows the user has been a reviewer for the case, the case will display when filtered by that user.</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b class="Bold">Activity Type</b> list includes activity types for which the selected user has access (e.g., All, Application, Illustration, Multiple Activities, etc.).</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b>Product Type </b>list includes filters for activities based on the type of product for which the app/activity was created.</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b class="Bold">Status</b> list includes the various statuses for the activities (Any, Data Entry, Signatures, PreSubmit Review, Review Queue, Submit Requested).</p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b class="Bold">Sort</b> list includes options to sort the search results by Date, Activity Name or Product Name. </p>
                <p class="hangingindent"><b class="Bold">Signature Type</b> list includes options: All, e-Signature, or Wet Signature. This list provides the ability to search for cases with the FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN tag, or by accepting or declining e-Sign in FireLight.  Declining e-signature in the FireLight UI causes the application to show up as "Wet Signature" in the search results.</p>
