        <h1>Step 5. Complete Reviewer Documents<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online"> [Reviewer Instructions]</MadCap:conditionalText></h1>
        <p>The organization determines whether to include reviewer documents and whether reviewer documents are optional or required.</p>
        <p>If the organization requires reviewer documents, FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> disables the Approve button until after the reviewer completes the required reviewer documents. When reviewer documents are optional, the Approve button remains enabled whether or not the reviewer completes reviewer documents.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If the order package includes reviewer documents, the reviewer clicks <b class="Bold">Reviewer Documents</b> and fills in the fields on the applicable reviewer documents. FireLight pre-populates some fields from inputs on the application. Those fields are display-only fields and have a white background.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> An organization can add Review Queue settings and fields for Reviewer and Supervisor comments to the reviewer documents in FireLight Admin. When the reviewer and/or supervisor add comments to those fields in the reviewer documents, FireLight adds those comments to the review Queue History and Audit Report.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The reviewer clicks buttons on the Reviewer Documents page toolbar to do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b class="Bold">Back to Review Queue</b> – returns to the Review Queue on the Review Queue page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b class="Bold">History</b> – opens the Reviewer Documents History dialog. This is where the reviewer reviews the history of only the reviewer documents.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b class="Bold">Save</b> – retains and saves the updates the reviewer made to the reviewer document.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b class="Bold">Complete</b> – sets the reviewer document to the Complete status. The reviewer clicks Lock and Complete on the Finish Reviewer Documents dialog to lock the document to prevent further data entry and return to the application order in the Queue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="../../Resources/ImagesReviewQ/RQ56.png" alt="Finish Reviewer Documents dialog" title="Finish Reviewer Documents dialog" />
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> When using Sequential Review Queues, FireLight retains reviewer documents and their comments in the original queue and across sequential review queues. Even though these comments will still be editable across each queue, the next reviewer is able to view them within the queue that they are assigned. Additionally, if an activity is rejected, the reviewer documents are retained, especially if the user would want to recall that rejection. This impacts all users who use reviewer documents within all available review queues (Post-Submit Queues, Pre-submit Queues, and Automated Queues).</p>
