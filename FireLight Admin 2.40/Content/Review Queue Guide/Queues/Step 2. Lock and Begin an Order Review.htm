        <h2>Lock and Review an Order in an Automated Review Queue</h2>
        <p>Locking an order (case) in an automated review queue causes the Provider to be put into a holding pattern for that case. This locking causes the Provider to bypass the case in the automated review queue. It is the responsibility of the reviewer to reject or move the case. The Provider retry is cancelled. The Provider will then have a time interval to check back on the case, but the lock is honored. If a reviewer unlocks the case, the Provider can re-lock and pick back up where it left off.</p>
