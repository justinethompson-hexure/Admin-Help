        <h1>Recall a Rejected Order and Return It to the Queue <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online"> [Reviewer Instructions]</MadCap:conditionalText></h1>
        <p>FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> provides the ability to recall the rejection for activities that were rejected from a Post-Submission or Automated review queue but not yet purged from the system. This allows the reviewer or user (with role code permissions) to recall that rejection and add the activity back to the Post-Submission or Automated queue from which it was rejected. The recalled activity retains all uploaded and reviewer documents when the activity was rejected from the queue. Application History and Application Audit include a message, "This application has been recalled from rejection by the reviewer '(abc)' and has been moved back to the previous review queue."</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If the reviewer group role has access permissions to recall rejected orders, the Recall button appears on rejected orders on the History page.</p>
