        <h1>Duplicate a Rule Set</h1>
        <p>This feature provides the ability to duplicate an existing rule set and copy all the selected States Approved from the original rule set to the copied rule set in FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup>.  </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the navigation bar, click <b>Product Config</b> and click <b>Rule Sets</b> to go to the Rule Sets page.</li>
            <li>In the upper grid, select a rule set to duplicate. For example, select the "Owner Rules" rule set.</li>
            <li>
                <p>On the <b>Rule Set Detail</b> tab, click the <b class="Bold">Duplicate Rule Set</b> link. </p>
            </li>
            <li>FireLight copies the selected rule set and all selected States Approved from the original rule set to a new rule set and appends "Copy -" to the end of the new rule set name. The Duplicate Rule Set will display in the grid at the top with a suffix of the original rule set name and “- Copy”, for example, "Owner Rules - Copy" rule set name.</li>
            <li>If applicable, change the new rule set name and click <b class="Bold">Save Rule Set</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b class="Bold">NOTES:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The "Copy" suffix will repeat based on the number of times the rule set is copied.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the rule set is locked by the current user or by another user, the "Duplicate Rule Set" link remains enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the original rule set is locked, the locked property will not be transferred to the copied version of the rule set. The duplicate rule set is copied as unlocked.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the user has read-only permissions on the Rule Set window, FireLight does not allow the user to duplicate the rule set.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rule Set History will contain an entry indicating the duplication of the original rule set name.</p>
