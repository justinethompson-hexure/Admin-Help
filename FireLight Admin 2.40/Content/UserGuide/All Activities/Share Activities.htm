        <p>This feature is available if your organization enabled user share in FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> Admin.</p>
        <p>User share, all activities and single activity, allows you to share with a specific user. </p>
        <p>Generally, an organization enables only one type of user share for a group.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Share all activities  allows you to share all your activities with another user. The user is able to view and edit, if allowed, all activities of another user including creating an activity on behalf of the other user.</li>
            <li>Single share one activity  allows you to share one activity with another user. The user is able to view and edit, if allowed, a single activity of another user. </li>
        </ul>

                <p>To the right of a contact name, click a link for the level of case sharing with the contact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="Bold">Share Full Control</b> gives the “share to” user full access to your activities, including the ability to create and save new activities for you if your group has share all activities enabled. If a single activity share, then the shared-to user cannot create an activity on your behalf.</li>
                    <li><b class="Bold">Share Read Only</b> gives the “share to” user read-only access to your existing activities. The user cannot edit a shared activity and is also unable to save the activity, send client fill and sign requests, and perform activity processes, such as locking, unlocking, checking out, and submitting activities. When the read-only access user views the case, any changes to data items that were initiated by a rule being triggered are not saved.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FireLight sends an email message to the selected contact (user). The user clicks a link to accept the case sharing.</p>
                <p>The shared-to user receives a confirmation message that thanks them for using case share. The user can access their shared activities by clicking their <b class="Bold">user ID</b> in the <b class="Bold">User</b> list (see <MadCap:xref href="Filter Activities - User List.htm" target="_blank" alt="Filter Activities - User List">Filter Activities - User List</MadCap:xref> for instructions) or by selecting a single shared activity in the <MadCap:xref href="../FireLight Basics/Shared Activity.htm" title="Shared Activity Tab" alt="Shared Activity Tab">Shared Activity Tab</MadCap:xref> on the FireLight Home page.</p>
