        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> If your organization enabled the Localization feature, you must update the copy of an activity in the same locale as the original activity.</p>
        <p>The Copy feature is helpful when a new activity is nearly identical to an existing one.</p>
        <p>Do one of the following to copy an activity or click the <b class="Bold">Cancel</b> button on the <b class="Bold">Copy</b> dialog to return to the All Activities page without making a copy.</p>
        <p>When “Copy As Is” or "Copy With Changes" is initiated, FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> removes the original activity's unused data from the new activity at the time it is created. Additionally, when an activity is locked, any unused conditional data that may have been added and then subsequently made inactive is removed. This prevents the extra data from interfering with rules and from being sent when the activity is submitted.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold">When a User Is Associated with Multiple Firms</b>
        </p>
        <p>When a user is associated with multiple firms, the user has visibility and access to activities that were created under firms other than the firm for the current session. The copy feature for activities in FireLight behave in the following way and do so consistently.</p>
        <p>Saved/Inflight activities are always associated with the firm under which they were originally created regardless of the firm ID associated with the current session. Different firms will likely have different sales agreements/product availability. For this reason, the following is the behavior for “Copy As Is” and “Copy with Changes” functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>“Copy As Is” copies the case and leverages the Firm ID information under which the case was originally created. This ensures that a case is not created under the firm for the current session as that firm may not have that product included in their sales agreement with the associated carrier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Copy with Changes” allows the user to reuse common demographic information in the newly created activity. The Firm ID and Role Codes associated with the current session are used in the “Copy with Changes” scenario. As part of the “Copy with Changes” workflow, the user goes through the selection process for the new jurisdiction, product type, product, etc., and those options are driven by the credentials for the current session.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>LexisNexis Integration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When either the "LexisNexis" or "LexisNexisRisk" custom action call has occurred, the application is able to be copied, but the LexisNexis values will not be copied over to the next application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For InstantID, those data items include LexID, NAS Score, NAP Score, CTI Score, Risk Indicators, and Pass/Fail Score.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For Risk Classifier, those data items include Risk Score, Result Code, Result Message, Reason Code 1-4, and Reason Messages 1-4.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
