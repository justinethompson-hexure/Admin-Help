            <br />- If you have Read-Only access, you can view activities, but you cannot copy or delete activities. <br />- If the Disable View Activity List option is enabled in FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> Admin, the user will not be able to access the All Activities page. </p>
        <p>On the navigation bar, click <b class="Bold">All Activities</b>. Use the features accessed from the toolbar to view, share, manage, and search your saved activities. Use the lists below the toolbar to filter the list by User, Locale (if applicable), Activity type (this list does not appear ifonly one activity type exists), Status, and Sort options. FireLight displays the number of search or filter results in red text below the toolbar. In the following example, the user filtered the list by Month and All activities. FireLight displayed “<span style="color: #dc143c;">..".11 activities updated in the last 30 days”</span> based on the selected filter criteria.</p>

        <p><b class="Bold">Personally Identifiable Information</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent">All of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data and documents are purged from the system on the purge date. A skeleton version of the application is retained, containing basic information about the application and the audit history for the application and the audit history for the review queue, so the user can still see it in All Activities and review History, but no application data or documents are retained.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold">When a User Is Associated with Multiple Firms</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent">When a user is associated with multiple firms, the user has visibility and access to activities that were created under firms other than the firm for the current session. Saved/Inflight activities are always associated with the firm under which they were originally created; regardless of the firm ID associated with the current session. Different firms will likely have different sales agreements/product availability. If the current session Firm ID/Firm Name is not the same as the Firm ID/Firm Name of an open activity, the system may present a popup/toast message to the user stating, "This application was created and is submitted under firm XYZ and you are currently logged in under firm 123." The actual language is determined by each organization.</p>
