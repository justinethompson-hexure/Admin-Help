        <p>If your organization enabled the Multiple Open Activities feature, you can have multiple activities open at the same time in the same session. An Open Activities (#)&#160;menu appears on the navigation bar. Create or open multiple activities and then go to a different open activity by selecting the name of another activity on the <b>Open Actitivities (#)</b> menu. (The number next to the menu name indicates the number of open activities.)&#160;When switching to another open activity, FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> auto-saves the current activity, except for Illustration and Quote activities, which need to be saved by using the Save number.</p>

        <p>To close an open activity, click the <b>X</b> to the right of the open activity name on the Open Activities (#) menu. FireLight closes open activities when the session ends.</p>
