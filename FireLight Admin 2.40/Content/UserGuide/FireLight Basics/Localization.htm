        <p>Localization is an optional feature and may not be available for your organization.</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> default language/locale is English. If your organization supports localization for other languages/locales, the FireLight user interface adapts to the selected language/locale as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prompts new users to select a language/locale on first entry into FireLight (users can change the default language/locale by selecting an option in the Locale list on the Preferences page).</li>
            <li>Displays the FireLight user interface (UI) in the selected language/locale.</li>
            <li>Filters products based on locale (i.e., separate products, forms, wizards and rules exist for English, French, Spanish, etc.). Select an option in the Locale list to filter the products by locale on the Create New [Activity] page. Upon product selection, the FireLight UI changes to the selected product locale.</li>
            <li>Localizes email messages and external requests to clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sample Localized Workflows for Applications</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>When you log in to FireLight for the first time, FireLight prompts you to select your preferred language (locale) and changes the user interface (UI) language to the selected locale.</p>
                <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> You can select the default Locale and the Jurisdiction in Preferences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>You begin a new Application activity. On the Create New Application page, FireLight filters the products to show only products for the selected Locale.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select a product and create an application. Because the product is configured to the correct locale and uses localized forms or wizards, the new application as well as the FireLight UI uses the same language (locale) as the selected product.</p>
                <p>Select a product and create an application. Because the product is configured to the correct locale and uses localized forms or wizards, the new application as well as the FireLight UI uses the same language (locale) as the selected product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>FireLight remains in the same locale as the application until you create an application in a different locale, you change the Locale in Preferences, or you log off FireLight. When you log back in, FireLight reverts to your selected Locale on the Preferences page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b class="Bold">Example:</b> Create a French application, then create an English application.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your selected language (locale) is French.</li>
            <li>You begin a new application and the Create New Application page opens.</li>
            <li>The products are filtered to show only the French products.</li>
            <li>Select a French product and create the Application. The product, forms or wizards, and FireLight UI are localized to French.</li>
            <li>Close the application and go to the Home page.</li>
            <li>Go to Preferences and select English in Locale.</li>
            <li>Go to the Home page or New Activity menu and create a new application. The products are filtered to English products only on the Create New Application page.</li>
            <li>Select a product and create the application, which is localized to English.</li>
            <li>Close the application and go to the Home page. Both French and English applications are in the Recent Activity list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b class="Bold">Example:</b> Filter on language and open both English and French applications.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your selected Locale is French.</li>
            <li>Go to the All Activities page to see all Application activities (both English and French).</li>
            <li>Open an English application.</li>
            <li>Even though French is the selected Locale in Preferences, FireLight changes to English to be in sync with the English application. The application and the entire FireLight UI are localized to English. This includes Signatures, dialogs, etc.</li>
            <li>When you close the English application and go to the Home page, the Home page and FireLight UI remain in English to be in sync with the application locale. The locale setting is dynamic based on the application locale.</li>
            <li>
                <p>You open a French product application and the FireLight UI changes to French to be in sync with the application.</p>
                <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> If you use the Copy feature to make a copy of an activity, you may want to update the copy of the activity in the same locale as the original activity to avoid some potential issues with localized dates, currencies, etc.</p>
