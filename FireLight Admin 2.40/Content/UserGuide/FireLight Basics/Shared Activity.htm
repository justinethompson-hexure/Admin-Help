        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Only individually shared activities appear on the Shared Activity tab and not when all activities are shared with a user. This list includes any activity for which your user ID accepted the single activity share request by clicking the link in the Accept Single Activity Share Request email. The Shared Activity tab is always available—it is not dependent on Admin Group settings for activity share. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a user group in the Admin tool has the Group setting enabled for Case Access by Firm ID for their role code, those users can access shared activities on the Shared Activity tab based on the firm ID/rep code passed over during the SSO login process. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Impacts:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>Shared Activity tab displays shared cases when "Case Access by Firm ID" Group setting is selected</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the Shared Activity tab on the Home page to easily identify and access individually shared activities. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the left of the Home page in the <b class="Bold">Shared Activity</b> tab, click an activity name to open an activity that you recently accessed. </p>
                <p>
                    <b class="Bold">NOTE: </b>If no shared activities exist yet, the Shared Activity tab displays a "No Shared Activities" message instead of a list of shared activities. </p>

            <li>
                <p>If the Admin tool Groups option for your user group is set to "Disable View Activities," the Shared Activity tab displays only the status and date of shared activities in a read-only view. Clicking an activity in the list will not open the activity. Additionally, on the <MadCap:xref href="../All Activities/All Activities.htm" title="All Activities" alt="All Activities">All Activities</MadCap:xref> page, the View button will not be visible for each activity in the list. The user cannot view the activity from the All Activities page. </p>
