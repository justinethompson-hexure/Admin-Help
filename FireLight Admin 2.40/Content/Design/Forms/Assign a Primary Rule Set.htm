        <h1>Assign a Primary Rule Set</h1>
        <p>FireLight requires a primary rule set for forms with multiple copies in a package that have rules referenced [FORM_INDEX], [FORM_INDEX_PLUS_1] and/or [FORM_COUNT]. All such rules must be defined on the form's primary rule set so that the rules engine can be initialized for each form copy of the rules. The primary rule set must be assigned to all packages the form is in via the  profile. The same primary rule set can be assigned to multiple forms. </p>
