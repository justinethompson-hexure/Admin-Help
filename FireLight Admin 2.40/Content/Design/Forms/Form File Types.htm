        <h1>Form File Types</h1>
        <p>Use the Form Designer page to add input controls to new fillable forms from uploaded Word .xps or PDF files or to enhance existing fillable PDF forms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Word .xps and non-fillable PDF files are a starting point for creating a new form. Create the layout and graphics, etc., and save the form. Upload the file on the Form Library page and then use the Form Designer page to add input controls to the form.</li>
            <li>Fillable PDF forms already contain input controls. These forms can be enhanced to include Label controls that provide instructions to the user on the system user interface but do not print on the PDF form.</li>
        </ul>
