        <h1>Locking of Forms, Rule Sets, and Rules in the Form Designer<a name="top"></a></h1>
        <h2>Locking of Forms</h2>
        <p>The FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> system automatically locks a form for the first user who starts to make changes to the form. This prevents other users from editing  the form at the same time. </p>
        <p> For other users who attempt to open the form while it is locked by the first user, the system displays a "User &lt;user name&gt; is currently working on the form" message on the form page and  disables the Rules Window link, Form Properties link, Form History link, and SAVE buttons.  Other users can only view, navigate between the pages or close the form while the form is locked.</p>
        <p>Example:&#160;Default lock time is one hour (based on what is set in the organization's database). </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the user clicks the Rules Window link, lock time for the wizard resets to that of the rule set timeout so that both wizard and rule set timeout are the same.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After 55 minutes of lock time, when the user continues to edit the wizard, lock time automatically rolls over to one more hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After 55 minutes of lock time, when the user is not continuing to make changes to the wizard, the system  alerts the user to save data. On the Alert box, the user can do any of the following: </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Click the SAVE NOW button to save the changes and release the lock.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click the EXTEND button to continue working and extend the lock for one more hour.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Does not click a button. After 5 minutes of prompt, the system releases the lock without saving any changes, the lock icon turns gray, and the following text appears below the lock icon: "The application is inactive."</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the user clicks the SAVE button, navigates to another page, or exits the form, FireLight unlocks the form. Another user can then edit the form.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If another user loads the form without locking it and another user updates that form, the system prompts the initial user to reload the form to view latest changes.</p>
        <h2>Locking of Rule Sets and Rules </h2>
        <p>The FireLight system automatically locks a rule set for the first user who starts to make changes to the rule set. This prevents other users from editing  the rule set at the same time.</p>
        <p> For other users who attempt to open the rule set while it is locked by the first user, the system displays:  "User &lt;username&gt; is currently working on the Rule Set" and disables the New, Update, Create Multiple, Delete All, and the delete (red <b class="Bold">X</b>) action buttons on the Rules Window.  Other users can only view and export rules or close the window. </p>
        <p>If two users attempt to edit the rule set at the same time, the time lapse when both users start to make changes could be in microseconds; the system ensures that no two users lock the rule set together, and there is no edit lock entry already there for the rule set.</p>
        <p>When edit lock on the rule set is released by the first user, the user who has the rules window already open for edit is prompted to reload the window if they attempt to lock the Rule Set. An Alert message displays: "This Rule Set is changed since this window is opened. Reload Rules Window to view latest version of the Rule Set."</p>
        <p>Example: Default lock time is one hour (based on what is set in the database).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>After 55 minutes lock time, when the user continues to make changes to the rule set without saving the rule set in between,  the system automatically extends the lock time to one more hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the user is not continuing to make changes to the rule set, the system alerts the user after 55 minutes (5 minutes before the lock time expires) to save their work. The alert message displays: "Edit lock will release automatically after 5 mins. Save your changes to avoid losing work. Saving will reset lock time for another hour."</p>
                <p>On the Alert box, the user can do any of the following:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p> Click the <b>EXTEND</b> button to extend the lock another hour. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click the <b>SAVE NOW</b> button to save the changes and release the lock. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Does not click a button. After 5 minutes of prompting, the system releases the lock without saving any changes, the lock icon turns gray, and the following text appears below the lock icon: "The application is inactive."</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the user clicks the Update button on the Rules Window, the system checks whether the selected rule set has been opened by another user for edit. If not, the system will lock the rule set for editing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the user closes the Rule Set window, an alert prompts the user to Save Changes. On the confirmation box, the user can:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <b>Yes</b> on  to save the changes and release the lock from the rule set. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <b>No</b> to release the lock without saving any changes.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the user loads another page from the menu, a confirmation box appears. On the confirmation box, the user can:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <b>Leave</b> to release the lock from the Rule Set and load the selected page without saving any changes to that Rule Set. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to have the current rule set remain loaded as-it-is.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
