        </p>
        <p>Use the Copy Fields feature to copy fields from one form to another form or from a wizard to a form. To copy fields on the same form, use the Toolbox (see <MadCap:xref href="Align Copy and Move Controls.htm" target="_blank" alt="Align, Copy and Move Controls">Align, Copy, and Move Controls</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <h2>System Rules for the Copy Feature</h2>
        <p>The following system rules apply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Matching fields copied together stay together.</li>
            <li>Any and all fields in an existing fillable form can be copied to a new non-fillable form uploaded as a non-fillable PDF or XPS file.</li>
            <li>Original fields uploaded with a fillable PDF form cannot be copied to other forms uploaded as Fillable PDF files.</li>
            <li>Fields added to a form in the designer can be copied to any other form.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Copy Fields</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the upper left, select the target form that receives the copied fields.</li>
            <li>On the left under <b>Input Control</b>, click <b>Copy Fields</b>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <b>Copy From</b> field and select the source form or wizard to copy the fields from.  Or type a form or wizard Name, Number, or Edition to filter the list of forms and wizards and then select a form or wizard from the filtered list.</p>

While these buttons might be available for copying from a wizard to a form, the functionality tied to these Custom Actions is not functional in a forms environment.</p>

Controls can then be moved and adjusted as necessary to fit form requirements. The default size for each control is listed below: </p>
