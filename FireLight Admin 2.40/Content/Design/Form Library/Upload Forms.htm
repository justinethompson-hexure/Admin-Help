        <h1>Upload Forms<a name="top"></a></h1>
        <p>Upload existing forms into FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> Admin. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Admin supports form files that are in fillable or non-fillable Adobe .pdf file format or in Word .xps file format. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Admin does not support Adobe proprietary file formats, such as .fdf. It does, however, fully support forms with existing tags, and they persist if present after upload in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Admin. So if you already have existing forms that are tagged for anything else, you can upload them into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Admin.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold">Important!</b>
        </p>
        <p>FireLight removes any interactive form elements from the PDF before stamping the data entry values onto form fields.</p>
        <p>PDFs with interactive form elements (e.g., checkbox with an "x" already added) should be flattened before uploading into FireLight so that form fields <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">and annotations</MadCap:conditionalText> become permanent and non-fillable and are not removed by FireLight.</p>
        <p>You can find information on how to flatten files on the Internet. Another way to accomplish this is to print to PDF using something like Microsoft Print to PDF.</p>
