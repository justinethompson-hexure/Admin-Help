		<h1>Wizard Grid Layout<a name="top"></a></h1>
		<p>The wizard automatically positions all fields on a 12-column grid. This ensures that the wizard is usable both on large monitors and on smart phones. Every container field (Group or Panel) that is placed on a page will have its own 12-column grid within it. For example, if a panel with a width of 6 is placed on a page, it is 50% of the width of the page. If a drop-down list field with a width of 6 is placed in that panel, the drop-down list width is 50% of the width of the panel, or 25% of the width of the page.</p>

		<p>When fields are placed on the page, one or more controls is placed in a row, depending on their widths. If two or more fields with different heights are placed within the same row, empty space is displayed beneath the shorter field. </p>

		<p>Groups can be used to place multiple fields inside the whitespace if desired. If a field absolutely needs to be placed on a new row, regardless of the widths of preceding fields, the field properties contain an option to position it on a new row.</p>

		<p>Fields also contain the ability to specify alternate widths for mobile devices. This is useful for scenarios where you may want to display two fields side-by-side on a standard monitor but have them take up the entire width of a phone’s screen. If a mobile width is not specified, it will default to a width of 12 when rendering on a small screen.</p>
