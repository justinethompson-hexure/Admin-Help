            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the checkboxes for the individual form fields to copy to the wizard. Or, select the checkbox in the title row of the <b class="Bold">Wizard Copy Fields</b> dialog to select all the fields displayed on the dialog to copy to the wizard. </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>When mapping from a source form to a destination wizard page, if data items from the source form are not located anywhere within the destination wizard, the checkbox column on the Wizard Copy Fields dialog adjacent to the "Field Name" is checked and the checkboxes in the "Already Exists" column is notchecked.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If a data item on the source form already exists in the destination wizard, the checkbox column adjacent to the "Field Name" is unchecked and the checkboxes in the "Already Exists" column are checked. This is the case even when a copy from a source form to a destination wizard has been completed but the wizard has not yet been saved. The copy process sees that these fields already exist on the destination wizard. They can be copied again but the boxes have to be checked as they are not auto selected for mapping.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>On the lower right, click the <b class="Bold">Copy Selected Fields</b> button. FireLight copies the selected form fields to the open wizard page in the Wizard Designer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the upper left of the wizard, click the <b class="Bold">Save Wizard</b> button to save the wizard.</p>
