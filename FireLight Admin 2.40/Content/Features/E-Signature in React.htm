                        <p>E-Signature  in React takes the existing e-Signature process that is currently in place and makes it available within the React system for embedded clients.   This allows a user to move through the e-Signature process outside of the FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> current Legacy system.  This is a phased approach: the majority of the current functionality will still be available, eventually allowing all of the Legacy e-Signature functionality to work within React.</p>
                        <p>The current FireLight release focuses on the Client API, specifically using the Sign Now and Send Email Request functionality.  This enhancement allows embedded clients to enter into the e-Signature ceremony to complete the signing process for their parties.   This feature impacts the Initialization page, Client Signature Choice Page, Send Email to Signer Page, Client Consent Capture, Presentation of Required Signers and Completed Signatures, and the Sign Now and Send Email Request functionality, which includes Document Sets, Initials, and capturing a signature.  The only piece that is not “embedded” but was built for REACT is the external signer who comes back into the signing ceremony. This enhancement includes LexisNexis and SMS Text functionality. This enhancement does not include the  Tele-Sign or Topaz functionality.</p>
                        <p>While this enhancement impacts the full Sign Now and Send Email Request functionality of the e-Signature process, it will not impact the existing Legacy feature, meaning this is impacting only Embedded clients at this time.</p>
                        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> See the FireLight Developer Help that is accessible from the FireLight Home page for API information.</p>
                        <p><b>NOTE</b>: The EXTERNAL role code governs the behavior of the signing ceremony for the signature request. The DEFAULT role code will be in effect for agents coming in a) without a role code, or b) with an invalid role code.</p>

                                <p> Implement Routing: To support users clicking the back button, Google Analytics, and general tracing, it is necessary to implement Routing. Routing can be thought of as changing the URL to represent the view that is rendered. This means the URL doesn't actually change, but the E-Signature views are all rendered and managed from a single endpoint on the server. A standard Route a user may take during the signature process could be E-Sign Acceptance, Signers List, Identification, Document Review, Signature. The updated Sign view is presented in a Single Page App (SPA) style of views. Where all views are rendered within a single page (or URL). Each of these views is rendered from a single page but the URLs would look like this:</p>
                                <p>./EGApp/Sign/#Consent</p>
                                <p>./EGApp/Sign/#Signers</p>
                                <p>./EGApp/Sign/#Identification</p>
                                <p>./EGApp/Sign/#Review</p>

                                <p>Initialize E-Signature Process: When E-Signature is first loaded, both the server and client (browser) must initialize any E-Signature model data. Note that a valid session is required prior to entering E-Signature. A session can be started by logging in to FireLight or using Embedded per documentation.</p>
                                <p>If a valid session has already been started, the initialization call should include the ActivityID that is being signed.</p>
                                <p>If a valid session has not been started, then a new Client API method must be called to start the session. This should work very similarly to the current logic except the server side model and state do not need to be initialized.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>E-Sign: Transition from Data Entry to the new E-Sign area: Both FireLight and Embedded clients will need to navigate to the new E-Signature views. This will work similarly to the new wizard Data Entry views where all views are rendered within a single HTML element on the page (&lt;div&gt;). The page that contains this HTML element must initialize E-Signature through a client API. This API will also work similarly to the wizard Data Entry views. </p>
                                <p>Note that a valid session is required prior to entering E-Signature. A session can be started by logging into FireLight or using Embedded per documentation.</p>

                                <p>Client API: The E-Signature client API is a means for the hosting page to receive notification of changes within E-Signature as well as call functions to initiate actions within E-Signature. This API should mimic the client API used in Data Entry where the hosting page can subscribe to events and call functions using the FireLightAPI global object.</p>
