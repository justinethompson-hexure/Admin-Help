                        <p>Integrate FireLight<sup>®</sup> with Cooperative Technologies (CT) to pull in the ceding carrier (surrendering carrier) data. The CT 1035Yellow Pages is a ceding carrier contact and replacement requirements database that contains up-to-date ceding carrier replacement processing location, contact information, and replacement form requirements for thousands of ceding carriers, including all Annuity, Life and Government insurers, the top Mutual Fund companies, major Banks, Fraternal Organizations, and large Pension Administrators.</p>
                        <p>FireLight uses the CRM lookup for the carrier search, pulls in the ceding carrier data from CT for mapping to the ACORD 951 eForm, and pulls in the rules to determine whether the exchange/replacement/transfer forms can be e-signed. If the replacement forms must be wet signed, FireLight provides an easy print button that will include only these forms and a subsequent upload button for the easy upload of wet signed forms.</p>

                        <p class="note"><b class="Bold">IMPORTANT!</b> The CT Yellow pages integration indicating whether the form can be esigned is built with the assumption that the carrier uses the ACORD 951 eForm.  Our base code logic to set the AllowEsign value is based on the form being the ACORD 951 eForm.  Our base code is not looking at logic on the proprietary form.  While we technically cannot “REQUIRE” and check that the carrier is using the ACORD 951 eForm, the value returned will give a false positive for the Allow Esign if carriers are using any transfer or exchange form other than the ACORD 951 eForm.  When carriers have only a proprietary transfer/exchange form and they want to use the esign rules, they need to update their form to the ACORD 951 eForm.  We have a sample loaded for that form. Some carriers use their proprietary form for internal use and the ACORD 951 eForm for the signing process that is sent to the ceding carrier.  That is fine, too.  Note that using the ACORD form does require the carrier to be an ACORD member. ACORD has a special membership rate for using just this form.  If all the carrier wants to do is map the pre-filled ceding carrier processing center address and location details, that can work regardless of the form.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Carriers must contract directly with Cooperative Technologies (CT) to have the surrendering carrier data and rules pulled into the ACORD 951 eForm. CT  handles all of the billing.</p>
                                <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> If you are not a current CT 1035YellowPages client, contact Cheri DeBoer-Stinson, Director of Business Development, CStinson@CooperativeTechnologies.com, 404-315-4450.</p>
                                <p> FireLight stores a unique licensing code for the carrier in the organization code and includes that in the web service call to CT. This allows <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to know who can use the "Get Ceding Carrier details." For billing purposes, when a client submits an order that has a CT call-out on it, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> auto-generates a file that contains the unique licensing code and the final selected ceding carrier location ID and sends it to CT in a Microsoft Excel file via email. CT will use this data for stats and billing.</p>

                            <li>For carriers that need the Universal ID sent to them in the DTCC file, the App/Sub 3314 record has the Prior Carrier Processing Location in field 4187  to receive this value.  Please submit a Work Order to have your provider code updated to pull in this value for your file.</li>
