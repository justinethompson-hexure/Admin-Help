                        <p>The E-Delivery Sign Only workflow provides sign only of client contracts. An e-Delivery Sign Only request initiates with FireLight<sup>®</sup> receiving an ACORD DocSend (TX121 and a TransSubType typecode of 12122  with processing instruction = <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"> Agent Directed or </MadCap:conditionalText>Client Directed) message that drives the E-Delivery Sign Only workflow. The organization's provider can have the ability to access the TXLifeRequest object so the provider can add and manipulate data items that are sent in the 121. The provider can be able to call the TXLifeRequest object for all agent directed and client directed cases. During the process, FireLight provides status messaging back to the carrier to keep track of the contract delivery.</p>
                        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> The initial e-Delivery emails for client pick-up can be resent with the trigger being a 121 with an ACORD TransMode 10 (OLI_TRANS_MODE_SUBRESPONSE). To trigger the resending of the emails, the 121 must contain the same TransRefGuid and PolNumber so FireLight can find and process the correct case.  In the event a child case reaches a terminal status that causes the parent case to change to any status other than "Sent To Client" (e.g., one party declines e-sign, thus the application is now a paper app), no initial emails is resent for any child cases. If a child case has been completed, it’s initial email will not be resent.</p>
                        <p><b>NOTE</b>: The EXTERNAL role code governs the behavior of the signing ceremony for the signature request. The DEFAULT role code will be in effect for agents coming in a) without a role code, or b) with an invalid role code.</p>
