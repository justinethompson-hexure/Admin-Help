        <h1><a name="top"></a>Work Groups</h1>
        <p class="FrameFooterText2"><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> The Work Groups section is available when the "Allow Work Groups" option is enabled in FireLight Admin.</p>
        <p>Use Work Groups to create inter <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">and intra </MadCap:conditionalText>organization workflows allowing users to have shared visibility into an activity, receive notifications for the activity life cycle, and allow members <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">from cross organizations </MadCap:conditionalText>to have the same visibility. </p>
        <p>With this feature, users can set up work groups and add members in the preferences view of the app portal. The Work Group section with the Manage Work button is visible in the user’s Preferences view only if the user’s organization has enabled the option in the Organization section of the Admin Tool. With work groups, activities can be shared with users within the same organization without using the case sharing option in the group’s options of the Admin tool.</p>
        <p>The work group functionality allows for greater refinement of sharing activities, because each work group can be limited by the activity type and product type. The members of a work group share can also be set to read-only for the activities in the work group share. In addition to allowing share access to the selected product types and activity types, the members of the group will be cc’d on any agent communications. If the member does not wish to receive the agent emails, the member can check the option to disable notifications for that group.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Workflow participants can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create activities to which all workflow participants have access/visibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Access status information on activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Receive email and FireLight messaging related to activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have group/role based permissions regarding functionality allowed on activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mark an activity as "Private" if they wish to exclude it from workflow participant visibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Delegate access to individuals outside standing workflow participants. This may be done with functionality similar to current sharing functionality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Receive all agent emails sent for an activity to all Members of the work group, as well as the Admin and work group Producer. All participants in the work group can choose to Disable Notifications by selecting the checkbox in the row with their Participant ID.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide case access to a select group.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following are examples of workflows that would be facilitated by inter-organization transfer of activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Sales Desk/Case Manager Interaction</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Post-Issue Changes/Requests</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>NIGO Correction Process</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Admin" roles of the work group have different permissions than "Members" of the workflow. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The Admin user who creates the Work Group is automatically assigned as the Admin of the group. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Admin user is required to search for a Producer. This is the Producer/Agent who will become secondary Admin for all activities in the work group.  The Admin cannot have the same user role as the Producer. They must be different.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Admin users can make edits to Work Group Name, Participants (Remove), Disable Notifications for an individual participant (selecting this option disables all notification types and cannot be refined by specific notification), and enable/disable Read-Only Access for individual members.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Permissions are either read-only or edit rights. If read-only, the read-only rights are followed at the group code for the activity. If not read-only, then the Group's session permissions are followed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Members of the work group can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Disable Notifications. </p>
                <p>Selecting this option will disable all notification types for the individual member and cannot be refined by specific notification.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>See their edit/read-only access setting, but cannot make changes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Remove themselves from the working group.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>See who is in the work group with them but cannot make edits to other members or have the option to delete them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new work group and become Admin for that work group.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Members of the work group cannot: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Change the Work Group Producer, so they will not see the "Work Group Producer" search box.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Add additional members to work groups where they are not the Admin, so they will not see the "Member" search box in their view.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Work Group Email</h3>
        <p>An email is sent when a Member is added to the work group. The default text for the addition is “You have been added as &lt;ROLE&gt; of the work group &lt;WORK_GROUP_NAME&gt;. If you do not wish to receive notifications for the activities created by the members in this group, you my “Opt Out” by signing into FireLight and navigating to “Manage Work Groups” from your preferences page.”</p>
        <p>An email is sent when a member is removed from the work group. The default text for the removal is “You have been removed as &lt;ROLE&gt; of the work group &lt;WORK_GROUP_NAME&gt; . If you feel you have been removed in error, please contact your work group Admin.</p>
        <p>An email is sent when a Member opts out of Notifications using the Disable Notifications option in Work Group in the Preferences view. The default text for the Opt Out email is “You have opted out of notifications for activities as a member of the work group &lt;WORK_GROUP_NAME&gt;. If you wish to opt in, you can reverse the “Opt Out” selection by signing in to FireLight and navigating to Manage Work Groups from your Preferences page.</p>
