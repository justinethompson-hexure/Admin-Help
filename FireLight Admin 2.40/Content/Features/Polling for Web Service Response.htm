                        <p>Some web service calls can take several days to process an order. This feature provides the ability for FireLight<sup>®</sup> to poll the web service until a response can be retrieved.  FireLight can call out to a web service at any defined interval to attempt to receive a response, which allows the user to continue on within FireLight while the call out is running in the background. </p>
                        <p>An example user experience is when an application has a requirement for life insurance, but the application requires underwriting from an external service that can take days to complete. You could set up a polling process so that once the result comes back from underwriting, the custom PDF from the web service call can be saved to an activity's Additional Documents listing,  and then proceed to the signature process.</p>
                        <p>When a call has been placed that requires polling, there is a toast in data entry that is customizable in the provider communicating that they may continue with their application and the display status is changed to "Pending Response" (a sub-status of Data Entry). FireLight allows a single async action call running per application.</p>
                        <p>Once a response is sent back to FireLight, there is another toast in data entry that is customizable in the provider communicating next steps. A message is sent in the message center, which allows an email to be sent  if the agent has the "Send Message Center Emails" checkbox selected in Preferences, and the display status changes to "Response Received" (a sub-status of Data Entry).</p>
                        <p>Only one async action can be run at a time in FireLight.</p>
