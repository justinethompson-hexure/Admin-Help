                        <p>The Account Opening activity allows users to create a pre-sale account. Account Opening is a submitted activity separate from other activity types (e.g., application, illustration, etc.) for reporting and downstream processing.  Account Opening has its own Post Over  to send users directly into the Account Opening activity or users can click Account Opening on the FireLight Home page.  The initial Account Opening screen includes the Jurisdiction list and Custodian list (if more than one Custodian exists).  Account Opening has its own output file for downstream processing.  The Account Opening activity can be used as a launch point into other supported FireLight activities, but the Account Opening, because it was submitted, cannot be edited once complete. Account Opening activities have their own transactions within the Reports.</p>

                        <p>If the organization would like to have the Account Opening activities included in application packages with the ability to print and view account opening PDF documents from the application package, have the FireLight team add a DocType of Account Opening with a Document Tag of AccountOpening to the organization's list profile. Then add an Account Opening template form to the applicable application packages.  If a template is not added, the document is visible only by viewing it in Other Actions/Documents and would then be included last in the final document package for submission to the provider.</p>
