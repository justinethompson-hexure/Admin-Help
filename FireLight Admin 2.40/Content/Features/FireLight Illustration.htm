                        <p>FireLight<sup>®</sup> Illustration   adds basic illustration components (user interface wizards, rule sets, illustration engine, and output), which provide the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">Guided Illustration and </MadCap:conditionalText>Illustration activities in FireLight. FireLight Illustration currently uses the ForeSight<sup>®</sup> illustration engine to provide the calculations and output for illustrations.   (Hosting of third-party engines in FireLight Illustration is available in a future release.) The FireLight Illustration feature supports only wizards (no forms) for data entry. </p>
                        <p>This first release of FireLight Illustration includes <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">base Guided Illustration wizards and </MadCap:conditionalText>base sample Illustration wizards and accompanying rule sets for Fixed Annuity (FA), Variable Annuity (VA), and Term Life product types. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">In the initial release of the FireLight Illustration feature, the FireLight base team maintains the Guided Illustration wizards that are included, which means clients cannot copy, create, or modify the Guided Illustration wizards.</MadCap:conditionalText><![CDATA[  ]]></p>
                        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone">Prior to creating an illustration, an advisor can optionally enter data in a Guided Illustration activity. The Guided Illustration provides a consistent user experience for entering data in each product type and filters the list of available products before continuing to a product illustration. Data gathered in the Guided Illustration activity transfers to the product Illustration activity. Guided Illustrations remain in Data Entry mode and are used repeatedly to gather preliminary data for product Illustrations.</p>
                        <p>If the client organization also has the Application activity implemented in FireLight, the advisor or agent can choose to start an Application activity in FireLight when the product Illustration is completed. Applicable data gathered in the Illustration activity transfers to the product Application activity along with the PDF output as an attachment.</p>

                        <p>If the organization would like to have the illustrations included in application packages with the ability to print and view illustration PDF documents from the application package, have the FireLight team add a DocType of Illustration with a Document Tag of LinkedIllustration to the organization's list profile. Then add an Illustration template form to the applicable application packages.    If a template is not added, the document is visible only by viewing it in Other Actions/Documents and would then be included last in the final document package for submission to the provider.</p>

                                        <p>FLI_AGENT_ID_NUMBER is now required. It is the agent identification number from the TX1228 used in the postover.</p>

                                        <p>FLI_SUB_FIRM_NAME and FLI_SUB_FIRM_ID are now required in the FireLight Illustration API. FLI_SUB_FIRM_NAME is the name of the subfirm accessing the system and FLI_SUB_FIRM_ID is the unique ID of the subfirm accessing the system.&#160;A contracted firm (the firm setup in the FireLight organization) may have many subfirms under them. &#160;The FLI_SUB_FIRM_ID is used to identify the subfirm. The DTCC ID is used for firms that are DTCC members.&#160;When the subfirm is not a DTCC member, FireLight will assign a unique ID.&#160;Add a rule to control the validation at the subfirm level.</p>
                                        <p>Following is a sample rule that checks for FLI_SUB_FIRM_ID. If it does not have a value then a validation message is posted. The same can be done for FLI_SUB_FIRM_NAME. If you do not have a FLI_SUB_FIRM _ID you can put a dummy ID in there. You can do a lot with this rule, which includes looking for specific values, including a generic dummy ID. Or, you can just look for the presence of a value. The following scenario is just looking for a value, not an exact ID.</p>
