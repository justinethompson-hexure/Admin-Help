                        </p>
                        <p>This feature provides a filter from the FireLight<sup>®</sup> Needs Determination activity to the available products to select in an application. <b>NOTE</b>: At this time, product filtering is not available in workflows that use outside needs determinations.</p>
                        <p> In FireLight Admin, the Needs Filter tab on the Organization Configuration/Groups page allows a group code to have rules and/or product filter categories defined for when to include a product in the available product options for the application selection.  For example, Accumulation, Income, Protection, Death Benefit, and Protection of Capital can be questions asked in the Needs Determination and based on the answers to these questions and others (financial profile, risk tolerance, time horizon for access to the funds), FireLight filters the list of available products so that only the products that meet the rules are listed in the available product options for the application product selection.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, a product level definition needs to be added to identify whether the product supports Non-Qualified and Qualified money, and whether the product is a Fee Based Product or Commission Based Product. The carrier needs to define these settings at the product level, similar to how states are defined. These settings can be part of the distributor logic in their filter rules.</p>
                        <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">The product filter leverages rules written in the Needs Determination transaction, the Product Category defined in Admin, and a query to define the filter.</p>

                            <li>Licensing is required to support this feature. Distributors need to work with their Strategic Account Manager for pricing. Additionally, each client needs to submit a Work Order to define their specific filter criteria for the products on their shelf. This needs to be done in conjunction with your Needs Determination questionnaire or SSO.</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Each financial institution needs to define their own product categories and rules to apply for the filter.</p>
                                <p>Because some firms have different distribution channels set up in FireLight, the rules can be written to apply to group roles.</p>
                                <p>Using the filter rules, FireLight can use weightings and scorings to include or exclude products in the filter.  Clients using the Needs Determination transaction need to define the rules, scoring, and weighting in the rules engine for the Needs Determination questionnaire.  Upon launching into the Application, the rules need to be evaluated and applied to further filter the product availability in the application product selection.  Submit a Work Order for the exact rules needed. For filter examples to provide in your work order, click the "CMR 147397" design document link in the "Additional Information" section of this feature.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>When using the FireLight Needs Determination Transaction to capture questions that are stored as new data items, the data items are defined into filter rules to apply to the available product selection in the FireLight application. Submit a Work Order for the definition of the product filter. Rules written in the Needs Determination transaction will assign data points based on items selected in the Needs Determination transaction. These data items are used to query the Needs Filter table.</li>
                            <li>When using an Outside Needs Determination, the SSO contain the data items that are defined in the filter. Submit a Work Order  for creating the SSO linking to the product filter. </li>
