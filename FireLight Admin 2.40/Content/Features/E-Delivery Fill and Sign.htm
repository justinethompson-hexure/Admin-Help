                        <p>The E-Delivery fill and sign workflow  provides e-Delivery of client contracts. An e-Delivery request initiates with FireLight<sup>®</sup> receiving an ACORD DocSend (TX121 and a TransSubType typecode 12100 with processing instruction =  Agent Directed or Client Directed) message that drives the E-Delivery workflow with the options to approve and request changes and collect e-Signatures. The organization's provider can have the ability to access the TXLifeRequest object so the provider can add and manipulate data items that are sent in the 121. The provider can call the TXLifeRequest object for all agent directed and client directed cases. During the process, FireLight provides status messaging back to the carrier to keep track of the contract delivery. </p>
                        <p>For the e-Delivery Fill and Sign Client Directed workflow, FireLight will store and send the Request Change client reason in the 1122 in the Client's Key Value section with the value of FLI_CHANGE_REASON.</p>
                        <p><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> The initial e-Delivery emails for client pick-up can be resent with the trigger being a 121 with an ACORD TransMode 10 (OLI_TRANS_MODE_SUBRESPONSE). To trigger the resending of the emails, the 121 must contain the same TransRefGuid and PolNumber so FireLight can find and process the correct case.  In the event a child case reaches a terminal status that causes the parent case to change to any status other than "Sent To Client" (e.g., one party declines e-sign, thus the application is now a paper app), no initial emails is resent for any child cases. If a child case has been completed, its initial email will not be resent.</p>
