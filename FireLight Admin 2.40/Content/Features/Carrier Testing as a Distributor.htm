                        <p>FireLight<sup>®</sup> provides a means for a carrier to test inside of a distributor environment. This allows carriers that have an active sales agreement with a distributor to have visibility of how their carrier forms, wizards, and rules function inside the distributor's environment, which could possibly avoid potential issues caused by rule conflicts between carrier forms and distributor forms. </p>
                        <p> In FireLight Admin, the distributor controls the level of carrier access to the distributor environment through a Carrier Test Group role code and  activates the carrier testing view via organization settings. </p>
                        <p>Guidelines:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carrier testing as a distributor is available in all environments except Production.</li>
                            <li>Carrier Single Sign On (SSO) testing is not available in the distributor  environment.</li>
                            <li>Carrier access is based on active sales agreements, which means carrier users with access to the distributor environment can access only their own carrier activities and products in the distributor's carrier testing environment. They do not have access to any other carrier's activities or products.</li>
                            <li>When the carrier user logs in, they have the carrier role code, but the distributor role code is what manages product and activity access.</li>
                            <li>Using the distributor carrier test group role code, carrier users can create activities and submit orders from the distributor environment to test outbound feeds (App/Sub or 103 or Name Value Pairs is sent).  This allows carriers to do full end-to-end testing in the distributor environment and make sure the outbound files are correct.</li>
                        </ul>
