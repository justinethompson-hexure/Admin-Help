                        <p>The FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> integration with DocuSign allows the option for clients to use the DocuSign services for their e-signature captures. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>DocuSign must be honored any time it is enabled regardless of the organization initiating the activity. When carriers enable DocuSign and deploy the activity to distribution, FireLight must honor DocuSign for the distribution as well as honor it in the carrier organization.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>DocuSign will support Remote Sign only.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>FireLight hands off the signing process for remote sign when DocuSign is enabled (email notifications and signing are completed by DocuSign). </p>
                                <p>When the activity has been signed, Firelight receives back the signature on the original documents. These documents include the signatures of the user, and each document is individually hashed as to secure the authentication of these signatures. </p>
                                <p>A full audit recorded with the DocuSign signatures is captured as a signature certificate. This is not appended to the FireLight audit report but is sent as a separate document to carriers along with the Audit report. Additionally, the DocuSign signature certificate is listed in the Application Packet Definition to identify the additional certificate to the organization.</p>
                                <p>The Envelope ID is added to the Audit report to be able to tie the FireLight Audit Report and the DocuSign Signature certificate together.</p>
                                <p>When the signatures are canceled through DocuSign, the Signing Certificate is deleted automatically, and the new Signing Certificate is uploaded.</p>
                                <p>When the documents are received, a FireLight audit is made within the audit history and audit report.  The display status is "DocuSign Signatures Complete" along with the timestamp and the session user of "DocuSign." The FireLight Audit message says "All parties have signed {0} through DocuSign." {0} is the Application Name.  The DocuSign Signing Certificate is attached to the FireLight Audit Report. The FireLight Audit and DocuSign Signing Certificate are available for review when the application is submitted. This includes the FireLight Admin Report, Review Queue, and the outbound via the provider. The FireLight Audit message within the audit history can be localized.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The DocuSign service can be used at an organizational level or set by a data item for a more detailed process (i.e., for a specific product, state, etc.).</p>

                                <p>When DocuSign is enabled, the Signature Audit is not captured within the FireLight Signing audit. However, FireLight  receives a signature audit back from DocuSign that is attached to the application and sent within the client's payload.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>FireLight needs the signed documents with the digital signature applied and the DocuSign signature audit returned 100% complete to FireLight. The clients that need DocuSign implemented have the DocuSign digital signature, tamper evidence, and audit approved.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>FireLight is notified of status changes via the DocuSign Webhook. If the call to notify FireLight that signatures are complete fails, FireLight will remain in “Signatures” status. However, DocuSign does resend the notification after 24 hours of the failure. DocuSign also provides the ability to manage failed notifications from their portal. This is a manual process and cannot be managed by FireLight support. It can be managed only by a client organization admin with authority to access the DocuSign portal.

                        <p>In addition, when a distributor wants to associate the config group value (a unique identifier much like Firm ID) with a specified organization, they can use the following rule for that value to be used with the DocuSign credentials. </p>
                        <p>For example, if Distributor 1 has a firm ID of "ABCD" for a carrier that needs to use DocuSign, then within the third-party configuration, this Distributor can set up this firm with the DocuSign credentials, and then write a rule that when this FIRM ID is sent in via the SSO, that the DocuSign credentials are used associated with the same firm ID.</p>

                        <p>Use the FLI_THIRDPARTY_CONFIG_GROUP data item to associate the config group value within the third-party configuration table inside rules. This is helpful when a distributor wants to associate the DocuSign credentials to a specific carrier organization but needs to identify that org using the unique identifier that is stored within the third-party configuration table. If FLI_THIRDPARTY_CONFIG_GROUP has a wrong value, then no organization is associated with the DocuSign and is used universally across all carrier organizations (get a 500 error). Currently, the FLI_THIRDPARTY_CONFIG_GROUP is used only by DocuSign.</p>
                        <p>The following rule can be used to associate the Config Group found in the third-party configuration table to the DocuSign functionality. The FLI_THIRDPARTY_CONFIG_GROUP data item can be used within any rule template or rule set within FireLight.</p>
