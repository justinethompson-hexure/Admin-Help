                        <p>The fee repository <em>queryfee</em> rule and repository manager are enhanced to support querying fees out of the repository to fill a blank fee worksheet.  This is a new option that is an alternative to querying fees based on a predefined PDF that is tagged with data items for each rider type.  The new query option uses a number attribute (number=”1” for the first fee, “2” for the second fee, etc.) to pull the nth fee in the list and put it in the worksheet.</p>
                        <p>The Fee Inquiry activity type allows users with access to the Fee Inquiry activity type to query the selected product fee values and display them in a dynamic fee worksheet.  This activity type is available via SSO and through manual selection of the Fee Inquiry activity.  The fee inquiry activity is a one-time view into the fees for the selected product.  The Fee Inquiry is not saved and will not be available in Recent History or All Applications.  The only action available for this inquiry is Print/download.  There are no other actions available, including save, signatures, review, send to client, or submit. The fees can now be pulled based on the order of the data in the PPfA and do not require a static placeholder in the PDF.  Only the fees that are in the PPfA for the selected product are displayed, which creates a more user-friendly fee display.  To do this, the enhancement added a fee attribute called number (number="1" for the first fee, "2" for the second fee, etc.).  The Fees and Expense License or DOL License is required to support the Fee Inquiry activity.  If you are already licensed for the repository, there is not an additional license and there are no transaction fees to use the inquiry. If you are not licensed, please contact your Strategic Account Manager for an addendum to your contract to support the repository. </p>
