                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Enrollment activity is simplification of the Application build and Participant signature aspects of the enrollment process. This new functionality improves the workflow experience for Agents and  Case Managers (CM). The streamlining of this functionality allows users to manage the workflow much more efficiently and allow the sponsoring carrier to enter a market involving larger group/enrollment scenarios. </p>
                        <p>Major aspects of this activity include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Case Managers are the primary FireLight users in the workflow. The Case Manager accesses FireLight through their existing SSO.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Case Managers start the new enrollment activity by selecting it from the FireLight home page. On selection, the activity launches and presents 3 data collection screens/views. </p>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                                    <li>
                                        <p>“Plan” page – Plan information is collected on the first screen. Plan information may include but is not limited to Employer ID (required), Employer Name, Ownership, Plan Type, etc. Full definition of information collected to be defined. This information is passed via common tag to linked/child applications that is created for each participant. Data collected/required will vary by organization. It may be necessary to assure fully completed plan information exists prior to allowing navigation to the Participant page. Currently, the Enrollment process supports only the Primary Owner and the Primary Insured.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>“Participant” page – The participant page will allow addition, deletion, and update of participants in the plan. The primary method of adding participant information is through census upload. The Participant page is presented in a grid view with columns to be defined. The grid view must support validation to identify situations where required information is not present or is formatted incorrectly.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Census Upload – The Census includes participant demographic information and may include product/benefit information. Product information included is used for the purpose of stubbing out product applications for each participant. For this reason, the product/benefit fields included in the census upload vary by Product Type.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Manual addition, deletion, and update of records/rows of the participant page grid should be supported. For smaller groups, the user may choose to simply add/edit participant information directly. In this scenario, there needs to be functionality to trigger stubbing out of new or edit of existing applications.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Case Managers use existing FireLight functionality to share the Enrollment activity with the agent of record on the case.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <p>Case Managers are able to send multi-life/batch signature requests to participants: The system supports multi-life/batch: </p>
