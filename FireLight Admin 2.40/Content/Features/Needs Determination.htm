                        <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">The Needs Determination activity collects the client data ahead of any sale transaction to allow the agent/producer/rep to make a best interest recommendation based on unbiased questions.  The distributor and the financial institution will define the questions they want to ask and supply that to FireLight<sup>®</sup> for tagging and workflow setup.  The data collected during the Need Determination can be used in the product filter to eliminate products that do not match the client need.  The process and completed PDFs is part of the audit record.  The completed PDFs is sent to any subsequent applications to be included in the e-Signature and review process if a Needs Determination template form is added to the package.  This entire workflow will create a defensible process for clients.</p>
                        <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">The Needs Determination activity does the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;"> Captures questions via the standard PDF with tags and rules and stores the answers as new data items. These data items can be defined into filter rules to apply to the available product selection in the electronic application process. </li>
                            <li style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">Has its own audit report, output, and reporting.</li>
                            <li>
                                <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">Uses the rules engine and has access to the same group option functionality as the application, post issue, and sub-pay activity types.  This will allow for different Need questionnaires depending on the group role code.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">To support this feature, there is a licensing component for the distributors and for forms tagging. Distributors will need to work with their Strategic Account Manager for pricing. </p>

                        <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">Determine the types of Needs Determination workflows for your organization. Submit a Work Order with your Strategic Account Manager to update your SSO, applicable database tables and rules for your organization and for any custom Upload button work, etc. </p>

SSO opens a new Needs Determination activity with the SSO pre-filled data. Use the ACORD activity type 116.   Submit a Work Order with your Strategic Account Manager to update your SSO. When the  application process begins, data items from the Needs Questionnaire are pre-filled in the product application as read-only fields. To make the pre-filled application fields editable, include the requested editable fields in your Work Order submitted to your Strategic Account Manager.   Also have an additional DocType of Needs Determination with a Document Tag of NeedsDetermination added to your organization's List Profile, so a Needs Determination template form can be added to the application package, which allows the user to print and view the Needs Determination within the application package.  If a template is not added, the document will only be visible only by viewing it in Other Actions/Documents and would then be included last in the final document package for submission to the provider.</p>

                                <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;">When an advisor starts a new application in FireLight (or starts a new application via SSO), but rules identify that a Needs Determination is required, Organizations need to define in a Work Order whether they want to support an upload or stop the application process. Note that if manual upload is supported, the FireLight Needs Determination product filtering will not occur.</p>
                                <p style="widows: 2;orphans: 2;"><b>Upload option:</b> The organization can add a template form so FireLight will know that a Needs Determination is required in the application. If a template form requires a Needs Determination and one was not sent in the SSO or pre-filled from FireLight, the system will look at rules to determine if the advisor can proceed and upload the Needs Determination. </p>
                                <p style="page-break-inside: auto;widows: 2;orphans: 2;"><b>Stop option:</b> Rules need to support presenting an error message if the advisor must stop and begin with the Needs Determination activity. A global dataitem FLI_NEEDS_BASED_APP can be set to True defining that the application is based on a Need activity. Firms can use this dataitem in rules to enforce workflow that requires a Need activity prior to an Application.  A rule can be set to ensure the value is true, and if not, provide notification to the advisor that a Needs Determination must be completed and they should exit the application to fulfill that requirement. Submit a Work Order with your Strategic Account Manager for the error message and rules.</p>

The source activity (Needs Determination) form can include input controls where the user can select the FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_JURISDICTION and FLI_NEXT_ACTIVITY_PRODUCT_CUSIP values. These input controls will generally be either dropdowns or custom lists. <b>NOTE</b>: These lists cannot be retrieved from the database or filtered by the provider.

Rules can be placed on this template to define if a Needs Determination is required in the application. The system will look at rules to determine if the advisor can proceed to 100%.  This template will need to be set to a Document Tag for Outside Needs Determination on the Forms page. The Outside Needs Template form could include a signature control. Contact your Strategic Account Manager for a Work Order to implement the necessary rules and Document Tag. </p>

                        <p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2;">The fields that pass from a Needs Determination to an Application are read-only fields. However, a custom action button has the ability to change the data in read-only fields by design. If the needs determination Application has a custom action button on it, an admin user can disable that custom action button by using a rule to hide the custom action button so users cannot change needs determination data within the associated Application. Following is a sample rule.</p>
