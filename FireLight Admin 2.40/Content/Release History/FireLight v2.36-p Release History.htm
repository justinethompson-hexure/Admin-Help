        </p>
        <p>With recent enhancements to admin reports, changes have been made to the CSV format due to width/column limitation in the PDF format of reports. For this reason, to generate the entire report, user must select CSV from the dropdown because the default option is currently PDF.</p>
        <p>With these changes, the default selected format will be for CSV to generate admin reports. </p>
        <p>The exception to this change will be Application Audit and Transaction Summary reports.</p>
        <p><b>Impact</b>
        </p>
