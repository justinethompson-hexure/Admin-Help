        <h2>2.25.137 September 23 UAT and September 30, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Console</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 268543 </b> Console Checkin fails to generate PDFs. Problem: Console check-in prevents apps from locking, but still continues check-in process on failure. Resolution: If there is an exception when locking and unlocking this should prevent check in. Also if checking in app, we should assume app is not checked out when locking. <br />Areas Impacted: Console check-in. Locking/unlocking apps</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269691 </b> Console cases - display Signing Ceremony Only forms during data entry. Problem: When App was Initialize in the console, it was not taking into account the Form Duty Type. Resolution: Fixed Console Initialize Process. <br />Areas Impacted: Console Forms</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">DTCC</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269875 </b> DTCC 99 items question/answer limit bug. Problem: There is a 99 items limit in the question/answers records, which needs to be fixed. Resolution: Loosened our validation requirements. <br />Areas Impacted:&#160;Apps going to the DTCC</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">E-Delivery</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 268446 </b> eDelivery Cases Coming back without Signatures on PDFs (2 Cases). Problem: Signature not included on PDFs for e-delivery cases in some instances. Resolution: If the agent signing is started and then exited, the wizard view changes to forms only and the continue button has an option for submit.  This will skip the agent signing process and begin the submission process.  Both cases were missing the agent party created when agent signing begins and were missing the agent signature.  As child case did not contain completed agent signatures, it could not be submitted along with the parent case and edelivery case would not contain the signatures. Fixed the return to form only view- e-delivery must always remain in wizard view to retain correct navigation options. <br />Areas Impacted: E-delivery after lock view and continue button options</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">PDFs</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 268824 </b> GetActivityPDF API returns documents not in package at lockdown. Problem: getactivitypdf and Print PDF pull latest forms in order to get optional forms. Resolution: If Locked, Don't get any required forms that are not filled out before lockdown. <br />Areas Impacted: getactivitypdf API and PrintPDF</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Wizards and Forms</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262482 </b> Illustration glitch when changing withdrawal or subsequent payments “Start Type” to age &amp; other value not saving. Problem: Updating Schedule fields could cause the system to enter a constant update loop that caused erratic behavior and could prevent further schedule field updates. Resolution: Fixed. Schedules apply their update only once. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266499 </b> Update field response contains masked values in DataItem.OriginalValue. Another issue was found with the current solution. The issue was found in an e-Delivery case that uses a rule that checks Original Value. Problem: The DataItem.OriginalValue was not getting saved to the Database because of the change to not serialize it. Resolution: The Original Value is only serialized when the value is not null AND the model is not getting passed to the UI. Otherwise, the Original Value gets serialized as usual and gets saved to the DB.<br />Areas Impacted: Clients using DataItem.OriginalValue for rules logic</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 269282 </b> Wizard - Fields being cleared and disabled, still showing validation messages after data entry. Problem: Under some situations, Wizards and Forms in Wizards would lose data entry when navigating between pages. Resolution: Fixed. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizards, Forms in Wizards</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.25.97 August 5 UAT and August 10, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266921 </b> Activity FLI_FIRM_ID data item does not have a value on some cases. Problem: For backward compatibility, the activity FLI_FIRM_ID data item, and also the activity FirmID and the user's FirmID, should always be set to the FirmRegistrationNum from the user's 1228, in addition to setting the FLI_CASE_ACCESS data item (and the user's and activity's CaseAccess properties), when the user's group does not have a Firm Org.  This was not always happening. Resolution: Corrected all logic paths for updating of user information and creating of activities to properly set the FLI_FIRM_ID data item and FirmID property to the FirmRegistrationNum in the user's 1228 when the user's group does not have a Firm Org. <br />Areas Impacted: Assignment of FLI_FIRMID data item during activity creation</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Wizards and Forms</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266167 </b> Wizard - Manage Optional forms dialog is not scrollable. Problem: Window would not scroll when 10 or more forms were available, hiding multiple options off-screen. Resolution: Changed from overflow: none, to overflow: auto, with some added CSS to hide scroll bar. <br />Areas Impacted: Other Actions, Optional Forms, when 10 or more are available.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.25.84 July 22 UAT and July 26, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Wizards and Forms</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266424 </b> Wizard - Date Slash Field Issue. Problem: Fields with a date mask containing slashes displayed "D_te Sl_sh" instead of a gray blank area like usual. The field behaved correctly once it was enabled. Resolution: This issue is fixed by iConnect 266448, which should correct all date fields and all other fields that have a mask.<br></br>Areas Impacted: Wizard date fields containing slashes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266448 </b> Wizard - Error locating &amp; rendering field mask during data entry. Problem: Disabled or read-only DatePicker  fields with a mask were not implementing the mask. Resolution: Fixed the code to correctly lookup and enforce the field mask. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Disabled/readonly DatePicker fields with a mask in the combined wizard+forms UI</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266455 </b> Wizard - Distributor mask is overriding carrier mask with the same name. 1) Problem: With the changes to masking in the 2.25 release, when the carrier and distributor define a mask with the same name but different format, the system was prioritizing the distributor's definition of the mask. Resolution: Utilize the mask defined by the form/wizard of the owning organization. 2) Problem: Testing did not pass in QE.  The correct org masks were being returned to the front-end with each page change, but the masks in the redux state were not being updated from returned model, so it was still using the wrong masks when changing from a distributor to carrier form. Resolution: Added the missing logic to update the masks in the redux state. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Field masks in the combined wizard+forms UI, in a distributor environment where carrier &amp; distributor define a mask with the same name and different value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 266499 </b> Update field response contains masked values in DataItem.OriginalValue. Problem: In Wizards for fields with a Mask, the response from the server on UpdateField calls included the un-masked value in the Data.OriginalValue property. When these fields are masked the raw data should not be exposed in the response. This is a security risk. Resolution: We removed the serialization of the offending properties (OriginalValue). These properties are not needed in the browser and remove the security risk as well as slightly reduce the payload size. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Clients using Masked inputs in Wizards would be affected</p>
            </li>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 260014 </b> Copy activity logic and data item properties. Problem: The latest fix was found to cause a side effect of no longer locking data items for a next activity when Lock Transferred Data Items is enabled (TFS 33675). Resolution: Moved the logic into the correct location and do not reset data item properties if it is a next activity with Lock Transferred Data Items. Problem: The original fixes for this were incomplete. 1) The changes to reset Enabled / Visible / ReadOnly data item properties on a copy with changes were not having an effect because it was being done before the provider had been called to copy the original app data items. 2) The changes to reset Enabled / Visible properties when opening an activity for data entry corrected the issue for the combined wizard UI, but introduced the original problem in legacy forms UI (which worked correctly before this fix). Resolution: 1) Corrected the copy with changes logic to reset the data item properties after the provider copies the app data. 2) Modified the logic to reset properties when loading an activity to operate on the original data collection, rather than a clone of the data items, so they will not be incorrectly synced back to the rules collection in the legacy forms UI (the common tag sync logic is specific to data item values and doesn't handle other properties consistently). <br></br>Areas Impacted: Read-only state of data items on copy to next activity.

Problem: The data entry complete popup (for which the default text is "Data Entry has met the requirements. You may enter more data or CONTINUE to proceed to the next step.") is always displayed for an activity when it reaches 100%, and there is no way to suppress the message, but it is contradictory and confusing to display this message if there is no continue action possible for the activity (the reported example is Print Forms activity, which cannot be saved and does not have a continue action). Resolution: Modified the logic to not display the data entry complete popup if continue is not an available action (this includes activities that can't be saved, such as Print Forms, and also if Disable Save Applications is enabled in group options). NOTE: This fix is specific to activities in data entry status (for instance, excludes pending review, activity finished steps) and also excludes some activity types (fee inquiry and needs determination), which have their own popup messages, and these popups will not be suppressed even if continue is unavailable.  Some of these popups have default text that mentions Continue.  It would require more research to determine if and when it might be appropriate to suppress popup messages for other statuses and excluded activity types.  It may also be beneficial to allow/support empty messages to be configured for specific popups in Activity profile to suppress those popups. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Data entry complete popup at 100% complete</p>

This can result in duplicate DTI rejects by DTCC if the same DTI or sequence number is used for activities from multiple test environments. Resolution: To reduce the likelihood of a duplicate, modify the base system to use different prefixes for DTI_Number &amp; DTCC_Number counters returned from the appService.GetNextIncrementalNumber and BackOfficeProviderBase.GetSequenceNumber methods: in UATNext, the first digit of the number is replaced by the digit "5" and in UAT, the first digit of the returned number is replaced by the digit "9."

The system now a) requires a single email address when validating email fields, and b) validates the email address at the point of sending, throwing an error instead of sending a message to a To address that is multiple addresses. Resolution: Modified email validation to accept multiple email addresses separated by semicolon or comma characters for the following fields: Organization -&gt; Failed Email Notifications, Review Queue -&gt; Email Group, and Sales Agreement -&gt; Deploy Email Group.
