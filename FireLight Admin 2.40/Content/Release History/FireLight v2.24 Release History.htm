        <h1><a name="top"></a>FireLight v2.24 Release History</h1>
        <h2>2.24.213 June 14 UAT / June 17, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262937 </b>  Radio buttons retaining previous values when updating application from illustration. Problem: Form fields have the “Group Name” field set to the same value so only one should be selected at a time. However, when coming in from a Quote, the updated value is being checked in addition to (instead of in place of) the original selection. Resolution: This was fixed.<br />Areas Impacted: Radio buttons</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activity Share</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263530 </b> Add Case Access by firm ID cases to Activity Share. Problem: The Group setting for Case Access by Firm ID is used to provide office staff and assistants in an organization access to activities based on the firm ID/rep code passed over during the SSO process. Currently, the office staff is required to search for the individual cases in "All Activities." Resolution: Adding the ability for the office staff to view activities shared based on firm ID/rep ID will provide an efficient process for locating the activity. <br />Areas Impacted: Activity Share for Case Access by Firm ID</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Client Fill &amp; Sign</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263819 </b> Client Fill &amp; Sign Functionality not appearing as option when expected to appear. Problem: A bug fix in the May release (iConnect 237487 -- Office Use Only Fields That Are Made Visible Show Red Required Background Instead of Green - Wizards) that  re-introduced the bug fixed by iConnect 230994 ("Wizard - Client Fill and Sign isn't presented until all fields with 'Office Use Only' are populated"). Resolution: Rolled back changes for iConnect 237487 and also made modifications to also exclude disabled fields from consideration for determining required office use only fields. <br />Areas Impacted: Client Fill &amp;&#160;Sign</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Email</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263823 </b> Review queue and failed email notifications to multiple addresses not being sent. Problem: This bug is for correcting the issue of emails no longer being sent when the To address is multiple email addresses. Resolution: Handle email values that actually contain multiple addresses, parsing into separate addresses and adding each recipient to the message, so that sending will succeed. <br />Area Impacted: Sending of email for review queue and failed email notifications when configured with multiple email addresses</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Purge Process</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 264167 </b> Purge process is permanently removing activities prior to the purge policy. Problem: The purge policy is supposed to: 1) purge activities at their purge policy, and 2) permanently delete unsubmitted activities at 2x their purge policy.  A bug was introduced in the 2.22 release by the bug fix for TFS 26661 that is resulting in incomplete apps being permanently deleted (rather than purged) at 1x their purge policy. Resolution: Corrected the purge process to purge activities at their purge policy, and permanently remove unsubmitted apps at 2x the purge policy. Areas Impacted: Purge process</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Wizards and Forms</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263040 </b> Wizard - Data entry non-responsive due to incompatible mask between carrier and distributor. Problem: Masked controls apply the masking in the browser and if there is a change the server is called to save those changes. However, in 2.24 when a field is readonly the server call does not happen. Resolution: The code that was preventing the update call when the masked input was readonly was modified to allow the update when the app was in Data Entry and readonly. Note, that if the input control was disabled the update call does not happen. The distinction between disabled and read-only is read-only controls can still function and can have focus, where a disabled control cannot have focus and does not fire any events. <br />Areas Impacted: This is a unique scenario between Distributor and Carrier forms where a rule will set a carrier phone number field based on a value from a distributor field. Also, the source field from the distributor view must be read-only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263435 </b> Error occurs when clicking Continue into signatures after clicking Continue in popup. Problem: In the Wizard view the Continue button was not disabled after continue was initiated from the toast message or by clicking the Continue button. This allowed a user to click the Continue button again, which resulted in a null reference error. This did not prevent the user from continuing to signatures. It either required them to retry or it continued after the error was displayed. Resolution: When the Continue logic is initiated the Continue button is disables preventing subsequent clicks. <br />Areas Impacted: This could affect all users using the Wizard Data Entry UI and continuing to signatures</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.24.199 May 18 UAT / May 20, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <h2>Enhancement</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Product Types</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">CMR&#160;261149 </b> New Product Type Request. Add two new product types: Change of Broker Dealer Request and Home Office. <br />Impacts: Admin &gt; Products &gt; Product Type</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 261899 </b> Enrollment - Send Request email not being re-sent but reporting success. Problem: When the fill and sign request is created in the client Production environment, the stored message does not contain the To email address.  This is because the code that initializes the message content copies the FromAddress, ToAddress, and ToName only if the FromAddress has a value   -- since the From address will always ultimately be no-reply@firelighteapp.com, this is inconsequential to the immediate issue).  When the user attempts to resend the request, the system attempts to send the message to an empty email address, which fails, but because it doesn't check the result of the send, the Send Request logic still reports success to the user. Resolution: Always store the To email address and name in the application message data when creating a fill and sign request, so that if that information is later used to resend the request, it will send to the correct email address instead of a blank address. NOTE: This will not correct the issue for outstanding requests, but it will correct the issue for all new requests that are sent (for new activities, or if the outstanding request is canceled). <br />Areas Impacted: Resend of previous fill and sign requests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262361 </b> Links in Pop-up messages not working as expected. Problem:  ULC.css file was overwriting correct values in the organization table. Resolution: Client .css items customNeedsCompleteText and customNeedSubmitText were removed from the css file so the organization table overrides are correct. <br />Areas Impacted:Client css customNeedsCompleteText and customNeedSubmitText popup messages</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262667 </b> Multi-App Functionality should not allow child apps to be deleted after submission. Problem: Logic to delete child activities in multi-activity and enrollment logic was specifying ForceDelete, which permanently removes the database records.  As a result, in some cases, submitted activities were getting permanently removed from the system, which should not be possible and can impact data integrity. Resolution: Removed the ForceDelete parameter from the DeleteApplication logic, and all calls with this parameter, to prevent permanent delete of submitted activities. <br />Areas Impacted: deletion of activities in multi-app, enrollment, and the system in general</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262707 </b> Pro advisory blocked from completing AOE in Avantax. Problem: Changes for common tags to sync data items between data entry and rules introduced an issue where a data item change from a rule could be cleared when syncing rules data when initializing grids during the initial rule run.  Data items affected in this case were ContractType, OwnershipStructure, and possibly others.  The sequence of changes was: </p>
                <p>"Enable Replacement 4 Fields" =&gt; setcontrolrangestate =&gt; "Replacement4Grid_AR" = "" =&gt; UpdateGridDataItem =&gt; CommitUpdates =&gt; ProcessUpdates =&gt; ContractType = null </p>
                <p>Resolution: Modified a previous fix for iConnect 258699 to only sync data item changes to rules during data entry and not during the initial rule run, preventing data items updated in an earlier rule from getting cleared. Also added null check.<br />Areas Impacted: Data item values during initial rule run before data entry</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263001 </b> Error when updating application from ForeSight illustration. Problem: This resulted from a changeset from version 2.23 not being merged properly into version 2.24. Resolution: Resolved by a manual patch in Production.<br />Areas Impacted: Illustration activities</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Branding</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262751 </b> Branding issues impacting wizard. Problem: Some branding-specific items for the client were not working well with wizards, possibly related to some recent css changes with the 2.24 release. Resolution: Set up a client-specific wizard css config that sets the Continue button's left margin to a smaller size, and colors with the edit name button/icon. <br />Areas Impacted: Continue button for the client, specifically location and color, not functionality</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">DTCC Processing</b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262981 </b> Error when processing DTCC app sub responses. Problem: Queries for app/sub response files were not accounting for the fact we are now re-using the Request table, and so they were pulling back attachment records, which was leading to exceptions in the code that processed the results. Resolution: Added in some logic to the necessary queries that ensures we only pull back app/sub records. <br />Areas Impacted: app/sub response file handling</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Provider</b>
        </p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262362 </b> The client provider update from UATNext was deployed to UAT, Staging, and Production on May 17 and is ready for testing.  It may also be necessary to deploy the form/product name changes to Staging &amp; Production.</p>
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262670 </b> Re-opened. Locked wizard UI behavior differs for presale continuing into application. Problem: Wrong error message text was being displayed for application submission of Needs Approval and other activity types. There were also visual issues with the Continue button. Text getting wrapped and icons displaying when they shouldn't. Resolution: This was fixed.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 262954 </b>  Issue with multiple source of funds pages in FireLight wizard. Problem: Metadata is being saved as the last form when there is copies of a form. Resolution: Take into account Form Index when storing Metadata on saved cases. <br />Areas Impacted: Saving Wizard fields</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 263167 </b> Reported slow response times when in Data Entry. Problem: The logic to load the model when navigating pages was taking almost 2 seconds to load signature information. Resolution: This signature information is only needed after the activity has been locked. So, this logic has been skipped when in Data Entry. <br />Areas Impacted: All clients using the Wizard view of Data Entry</p>
            </li>

Problem: The gender is not mapping correctly for illustration and sets to female each time. Resolution: The gender for annuitant and insured is mapped over for illustration using the description of Male/Female or the int values 1 or 2.  The export value used in this case was M/F and was not recognized and would always default to female.  Added the values for M/F to allow it to map correctly. <br />Areas Impacted: Gender set for annuitant and insured for illustration</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257859 </b> Application Submitted without Client Signature. Problem: The request to Decline Review was not validating to verify the activity was in the correct state and included and auto submit step that submitted the activity before all signatures were complete. Resolution: Added validation to the both the Accept and Decline requests to verify the activity can be reviewed. This will prevent an activity getting incorrect audits and getting submitted before it should. <br />Areas Impacted: This would affect clients using Pre and Post Signature Review. NOTE: this problem only occurs if the user opened an activity in multiple windows (sessions), where one session unlocks the activity while the other session declines review.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 258395 </b> NWL carrier is not showing unless "All" is selected from Product Type. Problem: The list of products (and based on that, the list of carriers) could be incomplete when the product type was Select Product Type. Resolution: When the product type selection is Select Product Type, do not populate the list of product types based on the default product type, which can result in a partial list of products, and instead display an empty list of products. Also change the default Product Type in Preferences to be All rather than Life, and add Select Product Type to the drop-down so if that is the current selection, it will show that (and to allow the default selection to be changed back to Select Product Type). Additionally, the reason that NWL carrier displays first in the list of carriers is because the organization name is prefixed with a space character—modified the carrier list for the new app workflow to trim spaces from the beginning of the organization name so that it is sorted alphabetically if prefixed with space characters. <br />Areas Impacted: Default Product Type selection and list of available products shown during new application workflow</p>

Problem:  The ready for agent sign email was not being sent. Resolution:  The option for agent ready for sign was moved to the group options and was using the session state to check for the group options.  These are not set for external signature requests.  The agent ready for signing should use the activity's owning agent group options to determine whether to send the agent a ready for signing email after the last external signer has completed. <br />Areas Impacted: Agent signatures when the group option for notify agent when ready for signing and agent sign last are set in the Admin group options</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 260014 </b> Copy activity logic and data item properties. Problem: On a copy with changes it appears the visibility and enable rules are retaining on tags even when there are no visibility rules that exist in the tags on a new product. Resolution: Modified the copy with changes logic to set all data items IsEnabled = true, IsVisible = true, IsReadonly = false. Modified the combined wizard+forms UI to also set Visible and Enabled to true prior to initializing the rules engine (only set IsReadonly to false on copy with changes, so that legacy behavior will not be affected, and due to the fact that data items can be locked on a next activity). <br />Areas Impacted: Copy with changes, default visibility and enabled state of data items prior to running rules</p>

Problem: The changes for iConnect 254568 introduced this bug, and the data items were being updated in the app only if also locking transferred data items. Resolution: Corrected the logic to always update the data items in the app, but set them to "read only" only if Lock Transferred Data Items is checked on the activity. <br />Areas Impacted: Update of app from illustration </p>

Problem: In the May release, with enhancements for TFS 29286 -- (256841) Support Display of Wizards in UI after Lockdown, the wizard UI is now used after lockdown. There was a bug in the wizard implementation of the continue/apply functionality that was preventing the next activity logic from happening.

Problem: Documents dialog is not closing in all cases, seen in specific case of an uploaded illustration document on locked activity. Resolution: Changed dialog close functionality to always close and prevent the situation where the dialog refreshes instead. <br />Areas Impacted: 'Documents' tab in toolbar on Activity pages and close button on the 'Documents' dialog</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 261989 </b> New activity UI - Locale selection incorrectly hidden with the product type selection.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257186 </b> Performance: Admin - slow loading of Groups profile. Problem: As per finding the performance issue on the groups profile page, we found that while loading the groups page on the UI, there is a function i.e. GetTrainingModel() to fetch all training videos. Under this function, there is an API call to Vimeo, which gets all videos and saves them into cache. The first time it takes time to call the API and after that it always fetches from the cache. Resolution: After understanding the vimeo API documentation, we found some more filters to get accurate data with fewer recursive calls. Before my changes, when API calls were made, it was found that there were 352 videos and the API picked only 25 videos at a time. To retrieve all of the data, the API was called 15 times. We found some more filters, i.e. per_page, query_fields, and query, to get only required videos and it calls the API once only. By using this concept, it improves the performance. <br />Areas Impacted: Groups profile</p>

Problem: When determining which items to show as eligible for deployment, deleted items would show (again) when any constituent item (package, form, wizard, rule set, etc.) changed. Resolution: Modified the logic to find eligible items for deployment -- for deleted items, do not consider changes to constituent items, and only evaluate the timestamp of the top-level item itself (i.e., product). <br />Areas Impacted: Inclusion of deleted items for deployment in All, Distributor All, Package and Distributor Package configuration scopes</p>

Problem: Changes for TFS 29240 -- Remove Benchmarks introduced two issues: 1) It caused all apps created within the FireLight UI (not via SSO) to always have the TestIndicator flag set.  This has the side effect of backend processing for most providers to skip the DTCC transmission step. 2) It caused all apps created within the FL UI to always have the EnableRecordMode flag set.  This caused unnecessary overhead during app initialization. Resolution: 1) Reverted the EnableTestMode group flag to be honored correctly (setting TestIndicator only if Enable Test Mode group option is enabled.  This option has nothing to do with the benchmarking feature. 2) Ensured that all logic tied to group options EnableViewTestCases and EnableRecordMode to disabled / no longer honored and treated as unchecked. Additional Problem: For the query pulling pending app/sub requests, parameters were out of order relative to the changes to the query for the new attachments enhancement.

Problem: The reminder emails, which always originate from the scheduler, have never supported branding with the company logo, because the scheduler does not have access to the logos, which are only defined in EGApp.  This is a long-standing limitation of emails from the scheduler. With the 2.23 release, apps processed in a workflow (for instance, submit, but there are several other workflows as well) which fail on the first attempt are now retried in the scheduler (this is intentional, in preparation for the cloud.  On the retry, if any emails are sent during the workflow processing from the scheduler (for instance, final emails on activity completion), and if the org is using their company logo in an HTML email template, the email will not include the company logo. Since this could impact emails that previously would correctly include the branded logo, the existing limitation should be removed, so that emails originating from the scheduler will properly include the company logo.  This will also address the reported issue of reminder emails not including the company logo. Resolution: Modified the scheduler to locate and use the branding images in EGApp. <br />Areas Impacted: Branded emails with company logo originating from scheduler (reminders, final emails, etc.)</p>

Problem: Two different scenarios have been identified where the From name in an email out of FireLight can incorrectly display as the organization email address or no-reply@firelighteapp.com. 1) When possible, the From name &amp; email address are based on the owning agent's login information, but there are several factors that can result in that not being used: a) The group option Enable Use Agent Email must be checked. b) The user preference option Use Agent Email for All Communications must be checked. c) The agent must have a name passed in their SSO or configured in preferences. If any of those are not the case, the organization email address is used as the final fallback for the From address &amp; name (and the default organization email address is no-reply@firelighteapp.com), and also for the AGENT_NAME email template variable.  Instead of using the organization email address for the From name, it should instead use the organization name for this fallback. 2) Even with the previous corrected, there is another scenario where the From name of the email message will not be specified and is shown as fl-noreply@firelighteapp.com, if the organization does not have Use DMARC configured in org settings. In addition, the system does not set the To name of any email messages, only the To address.  This is less noticeable, because many email clients will show the receiving user's name even though it isn't in the mail headers, but this should also be fixed. Resolution: 1) Default the From name in emails to the organization name instead of org email as a final fallback when not using the agent name due to group, preference, and user settings. 2) Ensure that the From name in the email From information is always using the From Name associated with the email message. 3) Trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the From address since it can prevent sending of messages. 4) Check for null or whitespace instead of null or empty when determining the email address and name values to use for an email message. <br />Areas Impacted: All emails</p>

Problem: Several Decline E-Signature messages were sent to the no-reply email address.  This is because the system is using the organization email address as the final fallback when the user's email address is not used or not populated. The system should never default to the organization email address for the To address of a mail message. Resolution: Modified the decline message to not use the org email address as the To address if the agent email address it not available due to group options, user preferences, or user email information. NOTE:&#160;This will prevent the email from being sent to the org email address (typically fl-norepy@firelighteapp.com), but the notification cannot be sent if no email address is available due to 1) Enable Use Agent Email being disabled in groups settings, or 2) Use Agent Email for All Communications being disabled in user preferences, or 3) the agent not having an email address configured.  Either the agent email should be provided in their SSO, or the agent's group code should be configured to allow the agent to set their email address in preferences, if the notification is desired.<br />Areas Impacted: Decline E-Signature notification email</p>

Problem: Z-ordering is used to define which controls display on top of other controls at the same location, which is used before activity lock when rendering fields within FireLight.  The PDF file format doesn't have the same concept (it might support layers, but the PDF functionality in FireLight doesn't utilize that).  When generating the PDF, FireLight first stamps labels, then other form fields, and the ones stamped last "win" and is the top-most controls and therefore will display over labels. Resolution: I discovered that if the labels are stamped after the form fields, the labels is top-most and cover other fields at the same position.  It isn't actually honoring the Z-order defined in FireLight, but it will have the expected effect of layering labels on top of other form fields. <br />Areas Impacted: All PDF generation in FireLight except fillable PDFs</p>
