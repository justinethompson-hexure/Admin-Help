                <h2>Enhancements</h2>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Display/Print PDF Page</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 163326 </b> (Available for all clients) A SML work order added a 'Check/Uncheck All' checkbox above the left column of the grid on the Display/Print PDF page in FireLight. Use the new checkbox to select or clear all documents in the list. This feature is enabled when an application is unlocked or the Enable Print Individual Forms option is selected on the App tab of the Groups page in FireLight Admin. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Email Notifications</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b class="DRnumber"><a href="file:///C:/Users/jmt0407/Desktop/Technical Writing/FireLight Admin 2.40/Content/Resources/DesignDocs/147639-ManualReviewCompleteEmail.pdf" target="_blank" title="Design Document" alt="Design Document">CMR 147639</a><![CDATA[  ]]></b>(Available for all clients) A SFG work order added the ability to send an auto-generated email from the organization email address to the agent and/or reviewer when an application has been submitted after being approved in the manual review queue. To use this feature, ensure Allow E-Approval is selected on the Organizations page to add the manual review queue step to the workflow. In FireLight Admin Profiles on the Groups page, App tab: select the Enable Submit Email for Agent checkbox to enable the Agent Completed Application email and select the Enable Submit Email for Reviewer checkbox to enable the Reviewer Completed Application email on the Email page. To make use of the new email template replacement tags, contact your Strategic Account Manager to add the &lt;CLIENT_NAME&gt; and &lt;FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER&gt; values to the Application Search Items stored for each application. The &lt;CLIENT_NAME&gt; tag requires a dataitem of the same name to be added to the application form via a rule. If policy number is not being set in the Provider, you can also add a dataitem to the form to set the value for &lt;FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER&gt;. See the Email page in Admin Help for a rule example and a list of available template tags for the new templates. Also added an Organization option to allow organizations to set the frequency of an auto-generated submit reminder email to agents. The Submit Reminder email is sent if one or more applications have completed the signing ceremony for all signers, but the applications have not been submitted. The frequency of the email is based on the option (Daily, Weekly, Never) selected in the Submit Reminder Frequency list on the Organizations page in FireLight Admin. For example, if Daily is selected, the agent will receive an email a day after one or more applications have completed the signature process. The email will list the application name, policy number, and client name (if client name is added to the application search items for the organization) of each of the signed applications that have not been submitted. (The list does not include purged applications.) To add client name to the application search items, contact your Strategic Account Manager. See the Submit Reminder email template on the Email page in Admin Help. </p>

To enable the new email template, select the Enable Leave-Behind Email checkbox on the App tab in Groups for the role codes that will receive the email.

This ensures the correct person is signing the document set during the signing ceremony. This is especially useful when the Enable Single User to Sign Multi Signer Types option is selected on the App tab of the Groups page in FireLight Admin.</li>

                </p>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">Additional Feature </b> (Available for all clients) Added two new Rules nodes, 'deformat' and 'elseif', to the Rules window of the form Designer in FireLight Admin.

The FireLight client needs to contract directly with LexisNexis for the services.

For implementation details, see <MadCap:xref href="../Features/Features.htm">Features</MadCap:xref>.  (The enhancement will look at the forms in the signing package to determine if any of the forms contain a LexisNexis authentication, and if they do, LexisNexis is called using the contracted firm’s credentials.) </li>

DataItems FLI_REDTAIL_USERNAME and FLI_REDTAIL_PASSWORD can be used to store credentials for the Redtail, instead of organization config settings.   You need both password and username in dataitems before it uses the dataitems, and these dataitems will override any config username/password.</li>

Added custom declined text for pop-up notification when entering an application that has been declined within the internal review queue. In the manual review process, the application is unlocked when the reviewer declines, so the review status is not updated to Declined.
Added additional information to the custom signature step text  for pop-up notifications on whether the agent, client, or both signatures are missing from a locked application.  </li>

An Email Preview of the HTML template is included in the Email Profile page in FireLight Admin. Organizations need to contact their Strategic Account Manager(PM) and send the initial version of their HTML template to their FireLight PM to be loaded by Hexure—very similar to the initial branding setup.  This ensures that the HTML is valid and set up correctly. See the <MadCap:xref href="../Organization Configuration/Email.htm">Email</MadCap:xref> Profile page for a sample HTML template and email preview with logo and color branding added.  </li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 158149 </b> DOL - Repository changes needed for CST commission schedule ID &amp; type &#160;– In the fees, expenses and commissions repository, modified the CST query to use common tag data items, FLR_Commission_Schedule_Id and FLR_Commission_Schedule_Type, to locate the correct commission data, which must be initialized by the carrier as needed.</li>

Clients that do not have access to email for remote signing or client fill requests, can go to this website, enter their application unique ID, authenticate, and then sign or fill.  The advisor needs to provide the shortened website URL and Passcode to the client via phone or text. The workflow supports authentication prior to signing just like the normal FireLight workflow. This enhancement also includes shortened website URL links for external requests sent via email.  </li>
                </ul>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 157354 </b> Override dataitems provider call is needed for all transaction types &#160;– Removed the check for application transaction type to allow a call into the provider for override data items regardless of the transaction type.</li>

This is at the organization level and goes across packages and duty types. Modified the rules engine to allow certain rules to run recursively, where if one rule affects another rule that affects a field, it is run again. The <MadCap:xref href="../Organization Configuration/Mapping.htm">Mapping</MadCap:xref> Profile contains a new DataItem Sync tab for defining linked data items. The <MadCap:xref href="../Utilities/Deployments/Deploy Data.htm">Deployment</MadCap:xref> tab on the Deploy Profile page contains a new Data Item Sync Configuration synchronization scope for deploying the linked data items.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 146992 </b> Identify data items that are in a rule but not in any forms in the package &#160;– In FireLight Admin, added a new optional "addifnotfound" parameter to the diget rule node, which adds the data item if it does not exist. This can be used when sharing a master rules form across different packages, and some of the defined rules may include control names that may not exist in each package where the master rules form is used. In <MadCap:xref href="../Product Configuration/Rule Sets/AdvancedRulesCategoryElementDefinitionsReference.htm">Advanced Rules Category and Element Definitions Reference</MadCap:xref>, see "Example 3"  under the "|diget" node in "|GetSet" for an example using the new parameter.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 155319 </b> New Rule Node: To act as if button is clicked &#160;– In FireLight Admin, added a new Rule Node, clickcustomaction, that can be used to write a rule to fire a click event of a custom action button. The custom action is called per the properties set for the custom action in the Button control. In <MadCap:xref href="../Product Configuration/Rule Sets/AdvancedRulesCategoryElementDefinitionsReference.htm">Advanced Rules Category and Element Definitions Reference</MadCap:xref>, see "|clickcustomaction" under "|Control" for an example of the rule node.</li>
                </ul>
