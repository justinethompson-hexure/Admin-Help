            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 251362 </b> eDelivery - Client Screen - Request Change Error. In the E-Delivery workflow, the custom sign out URL for the organization created an invalid redirect that prevents the user from proceeding to a custom URL during a change request.  An unnecessary parameter was forcing the URL to be used as a relative path within FireLight instead of navigating to the URL. This did not affect any other activity type in FireLight. Resolution: Removed the unnecessary parameter. <br></br>Areas Impacted: All clients using a Custom Sign Out URL. This is specified in the Organization Settings in the Admin tool under the App Signout URL Type and App Site Signout URL fields.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 251142 </b> Carrier Name not properly showing in "Carrier" when starting new application in FireLight - FIA Product Type. Problem: The original implementation of the Product Type Filter added unnecessary complexity (there was logic to selectively filter on either the product type or the product type filter) that resulted in obscure bugs like what is described here (for instance, there is another issue where the initial loading of the new app view used the product type rather than the product type filter). Resolution: Removed the problematic redundant logic and always use the product type filter (which defaults to the product type, so this change won't impact current functionality when the product type filter is the same as the product type) for the new app workflow.<br />Areas Impacted: New application workflow</p>

Problem: User who had not created any FireLight cases was not able to access the requested case through the api with firm id case access. Resolution: The final check on case access for firm id checks to see if the requesting user is in the list of users whose cases they are allowed to access.  As the requesting user had not created cases, the requesting user was not included on the list.  Instead the final check must be for the case that is being requested and whether cases' user id is on the list of users allowed for the requesting user.<br></br>Areas Impacted: Api requests for GetActivtyDetails, GetActivityPDFRequest, UploadDocumentRequest for users that have not created cases in FireLight</p>

IT professional services will work with client to resolve any issues.</b> Copying PDFs from Parent to Child causes duplicates when parent is Needs Determination. Problem: The changes for iConnect 248513 were only partially functional, resulting in this bug report.  It was never intended for a template form to be able to transition into the child activity and still operate as a template form, and the changes for 248513 are incompatible with additional changes in 2.21 for iConnect 224368 "Needs Determination Forms Order." Resolution: Rolled back the changes for iConnect 248513.  ULC's requirements will need to be implemented in a different way.<br />Areas Impacted: Document tags of documents from parent activity in child activity.</p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 251056 </b> Cannot Disable Pre-Submit Reviewer Completed Application Email. Problem: Changes in 2.21 (refactoring of email logic for SendGrid implementation) had a side effect of the Submit Email for Reviewer group option no longer being honored.  Because the system is now storing a signer type of -1 instead of 0 for review requests, the logic to determine whether to send the submission email always sends the email regardless of the related group setting. Resolution: Corrected the code to store a signer type of 0 for reviewer requests, restoring the previous behavior and allowing the group option to be honored. NOTE: Inflight orders, where the request has already been sent, will still have the issue, but all requests sent after the code fix is in place will honor the group setting.<br />Areas Impacted: Submission emails for reviewer</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 250923 </b> This was rolled back. Magnum Forms Renderer is getting hung up. Problem: Magnum was failing to reload after certain scenarios that caused a Wizard page refresh, such as navigation. Resolution: FireLight now maintains its Magnum reference, preventing the Magnum issue from occurring.<br />Areas Impacted: FireLight Wizards, Embedded </p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 250982 </b> Rules initialization error when custom list referenced by the table node does not exist. Problem: The system throws a null reference in rules initialization when a custom list referenced by the table node does not exist. Resolution: Made it so the rules initialization will silently fail the rule instead of throwing a null reference.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 251168 </b> SIG Embedded Mask Conflict. Problem:  When specifying a 2-part mask like the phone number extension the keyboard focus would get set the end of text box. The incorrect focus setting would then cause the user to input in an incomplete phone number triggering the entire phone number to be cleared. Resolution: Because of recurring issues around this specific mask, we have added a temporary change to turn masking off for any text fields utilizing the Phone Number with Extension mask. This will apply to any fields with the exact mask "(999) 999-9999 ?x9999." If a field is assigned this mask, the wizard will instead remove all masking for the field in question. This is to ensure that the correct value (including either a phone number by itself or with an extension) can be entered in all scenarios. A more complete fix is being added into 2.22 to address this problem.<br />Areas Impacted: This is only an issue for masks that are set in products containing a wizard—forms-only products will not be effected.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 250755 </b> ForceError option on rules not working as expected. Problem: There was a change in 2.21 to make the UI more consistent with 100% complete and Allow NIGO. However, this affected the Percent Complete and ForceError option. Resolution: We rolled back the above change as it was not an important change with any significant functionality.<br />Areas Impacted: Any clients using ForceError option on &lt;postmessage&gt; would be allowed to click Continue when ForceError messages were present. Additionally, the Percent Complete reflected both ForceError messages and standard validation messages when Allow NIGO was on.</p>

Resolution:  The save was occurring, but it was being saved after the transfer was initiated.

Problem: Changes in 2.21 for TFS 22326 "User is able to upload documents after activity is complete" prevent an agent from uploading documents for submitted activities.  This is incorrect. Resolution: Rolled back the code changes for TFS 22326.  The previous code was already correctly preventing uploading of documents for completed activities.  Since an app doesn't always go to Completed status immediately upon submission (in the review queue, or in pending transmission), the person who reported this issue may not have realized that the activity was not yet complete, and that uploading was still a valid action.<br />Areas Impacted: Document upload in app</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>For the exception: Two table rules pointed at the same data item, but used different list names. We don’t officially support this. The two lists had matching columns and is why it worked previously. Since the performance improvement, we keep the table in memory on the server. We store it strongly typed and we assign a type per list name. So when the second rule tried to access the data item with a different type, it crashed. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>For the validation message: Again, the performance improvement caused this. The table does not store validation messages inside its json. This behavior would clear out the validation messages each time a table node ran. But with the performance improvement, we kept the object in memory along with the validation messages. The only way to clear out the validation message would be to change the table in the UI, causing the in-memory object to be replaced. </p>

Create an attribute or element on the node that is configurable to call on the callasyncaction rule node. This would allow a save to happen on both initiation and completion of the async call to a provider. If this attribute is set, 1) a permanent save of the activity data (from the current data session) is performed before initiating the async action, and 2) when the async action completes, the pending data is updated in the saved app data, so that if the user never performs any more data entry in the session, the updated values from the async action is persisted with the activity.  If the user does continue data entry, it will still check for pending changes and update the current session values (like it does today) so that if the user saves the activity later on, it will include any pending data and their latest data entry inputs. </p>
                <p>This enhancement supports allowing the provider to trigger a save prior to a call and after a call is completed (i.e., Milliman). The benefit of this enhancement is, if a user exits the session without saving the data needed for a web service call, we will have already saved the data and it can be retrieved. The same is true if the user exits after the call is complete but does not  save, the data from the call is stored. Implementing this enhancement will eliminate a compliance risk. </p>

For the 2.21 August release, the FireLight platform is embedded into the IXN Quote solution. This will further expand the client access to FireLight and IXN clients alike for both systems. Along with this integration, FireLight will provide additional enhancements related to quotes produced in IXN.</p>
                <p>Enhanced certificate support is added to allow ease of certificate security management for IXN access and updates to the IXN certificate expiration that eliminates the need for user interaction. FireLight will continue to be enhanced from the previous release to include Save, Share and Transfer abilities within FireLight for IXN Life Quotes. The ability to add a document tag to the IXN quote PDF will also be added; enabling clients to add a signature tag to the quote PDF, if desired. Activity reports is created for quote to allow clients to review the number of quotes created, as well as the data for the volume of quotes that are linked to a FireLight e-Application.</p>

For example, present a final checkbox once the app is 100%. Today, to do this technically you cannot be 100% because once all data is entered, a new requirement is presented which means the app is no longer at 100%. The old consumer portal had this logic where the final acknowledgement and the next button would not show until the previous screen was 100%. </p>
                <p>This enhancement will add the ability for the admin to configure a workflow separator between wizard screens that must be clear of all errors before the user can proceed. This enhancement will eliminate the need to control the workflow via rules which is not smooth and error prone. From a UI perspective, when the separator is added, the wizard workflow will hide the Next button and grey out the screen navigation until all the errors on the previous screen are corrected. There are many use cases for this. One common use case is for agent attestation prior to continuing to signing. </p>

Problem: The issue with fields still visible after lock-down was due to iConnect 194752 "Exclude from PDF fields show as enabled when app is locked."  That change caused Exclude From PDF fields to no longer be displayed in the app user interface for a locked activity.  Labels with Exclude From PDF are being used to cover other fields that are not excluded from the PDF, so the fields on the PDF were no longer being covered by the label. Resolution: It was determined that the original bug fix was incorrect -- the Exclude from PDF option should apply only to the actual PDF, and not display of the form in the UI after lock down.  The code changes for iConnect 194752 were rolled back. The issue with sign later not being displayed was resolved by updating the AFA branding, which was previously hiding the sign later option, but no longer is, but the branding in UATNext was using an older version and hiding the option.  This has been resolved by updating the AFA branding. The SMS text part of this iConnect is a forms issue and not a base issue.<br />Areas Impacted: Display of Exclude Form PDF fields on locked activities</p>

Resolution: We have versioned the ActivityItem model so that it will convert the default icons originally specified to the new Font Awesome icon name.

Problem: client expects to pass an uploaded template document from a pre-sale activity to an application and have it function as an uploaded template document in the app.  This is not currently supported by FireLight.  Changeset 48194 for iConnect 224368 in the 2.21 branch sets the doctype to NeedsDetermination for documents fed over from a needs activity, which is part of the solution for this.  However, it still doesn't operate as a template in the child because the document tag is also being set to NeedsDetermination (for all documents from the original activity).  This is incorrect, because a) there must be only one template document with a given doc tag in an activity, and b) the client wants to use the same document tags in the pre-sale and application to identify these documents. Resolution: Modify the base system to still pass through the original document tag, allowing a) each document to be distinguishable and support operating as a template document upload, and b) organizations to configure their template document types for their needs. NOTE: This only addresses template documents coming from a pre-sale or illustration.  Additional changes would be required to support traditional templates documents (doctype AdditionalDocWithSignature) being fed over other activity types and functioning as uploaded templates in the child activity.  It is unknown whether this is desired/needed and what impacts it could have.<br />Areas Impacted: Uploaded documents from a pre-sale or illustration into the next activity.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 249107 </b> Hard to read illustration upload button in Pending US forms package. Problem: Custom Action button was hard to read in disabled state. Resolution: Custom action button is now rendering as anchor instead of span due to WCAG keyboard accessibility.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 249513 </b> Wizard - Unable to sign from pre-submit queue without message display when require manual review disabled. Problem: Auto-Decline Pre-Signature Review was added for fixing bugs 20051 and 20238. The logic for calling this was added for Edit Application, but not for Edit Wizard Application. The client's app used Edit Wizard Application, so the app skipped over Pre-Signature Review without auto-declining it. Storing the signature was failing because the app was still in the Pending Approval state, waiting for approval or decline of the Pre-Signature Review. Resolution: The method for Auto-Declining Pre-Signature Review was added to the Edit Wizard Application method responsible for transitioning to eSignautres.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard Applications using Pre-Signature Review and FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 249656 </b> Wizard - Combo items updated by rules not shown on new activity. Problem: The combo drop-down issue was a side effect of fixes for iConnect 248813 (changeset 48585) -- the data items associated with wizard pages was not including the drop-down list items initialized by setcomboitems rules on a new activity. Restored the previous logic to (re)initialize the page map after the initial rule run so that any drop-down list data items created by rules will exist in the map and be loaded in the wizard UI.<br />Areas Impacted: Drop-down lists in wizard UI updated from setcomboitems rules on new activities.</p>
