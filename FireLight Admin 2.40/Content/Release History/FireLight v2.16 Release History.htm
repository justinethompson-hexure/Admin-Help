            <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 208539 </b> In Organization Configuration/Organization Settings on the Security tab, added a CORS Origins text box for admins to have the ability to view allowed origins for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in FireLight. CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. This field is read only.  </li>

These changes have been backed out and will need to be implemented more strategically in a future release.  QE, UAT and Staging have been patched 12/7/2019.</b> Formerly, when a distributor used Copy with Changes they were allowed to copy the activity to another carrier’s product. When this happened, AppSub codes from the original case could remain in the new case’s AppSub file. Now when Copy with Changes occurs, the base system clears the case of any data related to the prior carrier to prevent data from being retained and potentially being transmitted in the AppSub file. When Copy with Changes occurs, the base system clears the case of any base, provider, rule and unknown scoped data related to the prior carrier, but retains the user-entered and 103 pre-filled data. The clear provider will apply to both Copy with Changes across carriers and Copy with Changes in the same carrier. Once the user data and 103 pre-filled data are applied, the new provider will run.     This prevents  product  data from being retained and potentially being transmitted in the AppSub file. This update will remove any potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that could be passed to another carrier. </p>
                <p>Clear Provider Impacts:</p>

The export values of Redtail, Salesforce, Whitepages, NPIS, or None is set based on the agent's Preferences setting. This allows carriers to create wizards to interact with the CRM Preferences setup for the logged in agent. Firms can write rules associated with the CRM Preferences. For example, if Salesforce is set up in the CRM Preferences for the logged in agent, display the Pull data from the Salesforce custom action button.</p>

                <p>When a user creates a new Dropdown List field in a wizard or a Combo Box field in a form and adds a common tag in the Name field property, the autocomplete feature automatically adds the Item Source list values  to the field.

        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 213031 </b> This enhancement includes two improvements to the Common Tag Conversion tools that were introduced in 2.14.  The two improvements were identified during demos and training.  Prior to this release, the spreadsheet only included the common tags in the downloaded report and it did not include the Export Values.  Secondly, we did not have a way to only identify the data items that are not common tags.  With 2.16, these two issues have been addressed.  We added logic to include all export values from the forms and wizards as well as the common tags. This will help the user and eliminate the need to go back to the forms to determine the export values and enter the values manually into the spreadsheet.  Additionally, we added a checkbox on the Download tag list page to determine if Non-Matching Common tags are in the download tag list tool. This checkbox is used to include only tag names that do not align with our Common tags in FireLight. Clients will still be able to pull all values simply by not checking that box.</li>

                        <li>Optional capabilities with the Provider - adding Metadata to know where documents originate from and have the option to exclude documents from the provider.</li>
                        <li>Organizational Settings for a new table - added a licensing table to determine if Activities have been licensed for an organization, and the ability to control deployments for these licensed events.</li>

This is necessary to assure that distributors have been notified of deployments that may change their users' experience relative to that carriers activities. This also includes the ability to coordinate notification by carriers regardless of "Auto Deploy" setting in the distributor environment.</p>

This package history/audit report is similar to the existing history/audit report for forms and rules available currently. It will have a timestamp, indicate the user making the changes and indicate the timestamp of the change. This enhancement will help the carrier admin manage form and wizard updates, package changes, product updates, product changes, sales agreement updates, and sales agreement changes. This will also allow a user to triage Package, Product, and Sales Agreement issues such as forms being incorrectly added or removed from the Packages, changes to the Products, and Sales Agreement changes that can impact correct workflow.</p>

With this project, firms can use the FireLight Rules API for any activity type (needs determination, presale, e-Application, etc.) and return dataitem ID values and validation messages. The input is a JSON file passed to FireLight via the API. The FireLight rules will run and return a response of updated dataitem ID values and validation messages.

Users can selectively display the data. When focus is on a given field, the contents are visible. The user can display all of the data on a page to review for accuracy by clicking a toggle button in the page title bar to show or hide all data entry on the page for a limited period of time.  Obfuscation encompasses all fields on the UI—fields in both carrier and distributor form packages and FireLight UI fields that are part of the activity workflow.  </p>
                <p>Obfuscation Impacts:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Admin – Groups, <MadCap:xref href="../Organization Configuration/Groups/App.htm">App</MadCap:xref> tab: Under Obfuscation/Screen Security settings, added "Enable Obfuscation"  and "Timeout" options for enabling obfuscation and setting the number of seconds for the data to remain visible in periods of inactivity. In Timeout, an entry of zero (0) = None, which means data is obfuscated immediately.</li>
                    <li>FireLight UI: Added a <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture83.png" alt="Obfuscation Icon" title="Obfuscation Icon" /> toggle button to the page title bar the user can click to show the data or click the <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture91.png" alt="Obfuscation Toggle Button - Hide Data" title="Obfuscation Toggle Button - Hide Data" /> toggle button again to hide the obfuscated data on the page.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Status Complete Review Status Approved is now Review: Approved</li>

                                    <li>Status In Review More Info Requested is now Review: Info Requested. </li>
                                    <li>In the external status, the Review Status will now reflect “Carrier Status” and display the new post-submission statuses, which include: Approved (Carrier status), Declined (Carrier status), and Further Review (Carrier status).

                            <li>Recent Activity and All Activities Icon (new for only Post Submission Statuses). When a notification comes through the Provider post submission polling call, a message center "envelope" <img src="../Resources/ImagesAdmin/Capture84.png" alt="Post Submission Message Icon" title="Post Submission Message Icon" /> icon displays next to the post-submission activity on the Home page in the Recent Activity list and on the All Activities page in the activities list.

                        <p>API Impact for anyone using the External Review API – Review Statuses will now display in the Display status. There should be no impact to this service, but testing will need to be performed by clients who have this implemented to verify this works as expected.</p>
                    </li>

We are calling these Print Only products. All forms and packages managed by Hexure that do not have a supporting carrier to receive submission will only be available for Print; hence, they are called Print Only Products.</p>
                <p>Hexure can load and manage any form a distributor needs available in FireLight for a Print Only activity including account opening paperwork, mutual fund forms, 529 forms, life forms, etc. Additionally, Hexure can manage rate tables and product details when a sponsoring carrier does not want to manage these tasks themselves.</p>
                <p>Access to products: Distributors is able to access these forms using the same carrier/product/jurisdiction selection available today for the existing activities, but non-sponsored products will use the Print Forms logic. The package type delineates the activity type (Application, Post Issue, etc.). Added a new "Include Print Only Products" setting in each existing activity (except E-Delivery) in the Admin/Product Configuration/Activities page. This setting allows a one-stop location for agents to access both full sponsored activities like e-Applications and Print Forms. Distributors will still need to grant product access, but if the product is enabled, these non-sponsored products is available under the normal application, subpay, print form, post issue, quote, and illustration activities. If accessed via application, quote, illustration and post issue, FireLight logic will identify that the product is non-sponsored and only allow Print. e-Signature will not be available for non-sponsored forms. Upon submit, no submit will occur. Distributors, Licensing is required to use these forms.</p>

The automated review queue  performs web service calls through the use of the provider, which allows clients to build customized review queue workflows with the specific web service call needed to support the desired workflow. For example, clients can use this workflow and the provider to build automated queues for underwriting reviews, funds availability checks, NIGO checks, etc. As the web service is triggered, response messages is sent to the queue (i.e., reject or approve) to move the activity either to an approved-submitted or rejected status. </p>
                <p>In the Reviewer dashboard, FireLight adds an indicator for the review type so it is easy to identify the PreSubmit Review, Post Submit Review, and any automated review queues.</p>

        <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Admin</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 203738, 208663 </b> Save As results in error with Disable Copy Activities group option. Save As was not working for the Illustration or Quote activities when the "Disable Copy Activity" group option was selected. This was fixed by hiding the "Save As" button in activities other than  the Illustration or Quote activities, but still showing the "Save As" button in the Illustration and Quote activities, when the "Disable Copy Activities" group option is selected. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 206659 </b> Deployment - detect mismatched package info. Deployments sometimes caused mismatched package information. Implemented checks for missing package information to allow issues to be corrected without support intervention. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 206920 </b> Carrier Custom List Deployment - Include Carrier Name. The carrier organization name was not showing in the Organization column on the Deployments page when the distributor selected the Carrier Only Custom List Configuration synchronization scope. This was fixed.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 208422 </b> Quote rule set was visible to non-vendor user in the form designer. Hidden rule sets should not be visible to non-Vendor users. Removed the Quote rule set from the Form Designer/Rules Window and from the Wizard Designer/Edit Rules window. <br />Areas impacted: Package details when you first navigate to the packages view without selecting a package in the package list.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 208837 </b> Admin deployment feature considered wizards as having changed when up to date. It affected deployment of Form, Distributor Form, Package, Distributor Package, All, and Distributor All synchronization scopes. This was fixed by modifying the additional data check to exclude wizard forms. <br />Areas impacted: Deployment of Form, Distributor Form, Package, Distributor Package, All, and Distributor All scopes.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 209878 </b> Custom list upload bugs. When uploading a custom list, the logic did not exclude empty values, which should be excluded, and if there were duplicate column names, the message "Cannot upload the list. Column names must be unique." was not shown to the user.  It still reported that the list was uploaded even though it wasn't. This was fixed.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 210760 </b> Could not create a new Supported Services Configuration for API Access. The Supported Services section of the Organization Security page was occasionally losing certificates, and neither vendor nor individual organizations were able to edit the checkboxes for API Access, Illustration Access, Embedded, or IDP. This was fixed by updating the page to allow any organization to edit their own services, as long as they have the list profile entries needed to enable them. <br />Areas impacted: The Supported Services section of the Security tab in the Organizations page.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 212389 </b> PostMessage Rule node allows a null message. The PostMessage node was allowing the message to be null, which caused null reference errors later when using that property. This was fixed. If the PostMessage node receives a message that is null we convert it to an empty string. <br />Areas Impacted: All Rules processing.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 212911 </b> Rule node getCurrentFormNumber throws with null reference. The logic to get the page number  was not handling a null value from FLI_CURRENT_LOCATION. This was fixed. If FLI_CURRENT_LOCATION is null then the logic defaults to an empty string. <br />Areas Impacted - Rules that use getCurrentFormNumber</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214739 </b> Unable to save a sales agreement after adding a Tele-Sign script. There was a bug related to changes for auditing of sales agreement changes, resulting in an exception when saving. This was fixed. Patched Production 12/7/2019.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214774 </b> Distributor Sales Agreements unable to save changes. This was a bug related to changes for tracking Sales Agreement History. This was fixed. Patched Production 12/13/2019.<br />Areas Impacted: Saving of Sales Agreements for distributors.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213797 </b> Sales Agreement - unable to set package order. The packages could be moved, but did not remain in that order after saving. This was fixed by removing the limitation that prevented distributor and carrier packages from being freely ordered anywhere in the sales agreement. Patched Prod 1/10/2020.<br />Areas Impacted: Sales agreements, intermingling of distributor and carrier packages.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">All Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 208572 </b> Database deadlock loading All Activities view. Updated GetUserAccess and GetApplicationStatusCount queries with NOLOCK hint to potentially avoid the deadlocks. <br />Area Impacted: FireLight application Home and All Activities views.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 209003 </b> Batch / multi-life view was not working. This was fixed. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213280 </b> Status for completed applications is "Review: Info Requested" instead of "Complete." This was fixed by updating a migration script in UATNext. Some older purged apps may still show this way, but the majority should now show "Complete."<br />Areas Impacted: Completed applications in All Activities.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214111 </b> Time zone conversion incorrect in application history. On the All Activities page, the Last Audit History time did not match the time in the History dialog. This was fixed by removing the time zone that is no longer needed. <br />Areas Impacted: Application history in All Activities, application, and wizard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Applications</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 210873 </b> Cannot create activity because of application name length. Application cannot be created with an application name longer than 255 characters due to database character limit on the column. This was fixed. Added a limit in the create new application text field for Name.  Also added in a truncation of the application name with ellipses indicating it had been truncated for post-over and API app creation. <br />Areas Impacted:  Create new application through UI, post-over, API, copy app. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 211720 </b> If a product name has a special character (a period) then the product name doesn't show in the Summary dialog from the Other Actions menu. The period in the name was effecting the display text. This was fixed. Used an overload method to allow for the period in the product name.<br />Areas Impacted: Summary dialog.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213135 </b> Replacement product notification was not working. Notification for when a product has been replaced was not showing in FireLight. This was fixed. Modified logic to check if it has been replaced to pull the information directly from the database as what was stored in memory was incorrect.<br />Areas Impacted: Edit application page.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213331 </b> Unable to open application created from 103 with Use Resident State sales agreement option. The applications were being created via a 103 in the SSO, which does not have a provision for setting the resident jurisdiction, and it gets set to 0 (which is not a valid jurisdiction), resulting in an error when opening the application if the 'Use Resident State for Form Selection' sales agreement option was enabled. This was fixed by modifying the system to use the app jurisdiction for the resident jurisdiction when resident jurisdiction is 0.<br />Areas Impacted: Initializing of application forms when opening activities in the legacy e-Application and the combined wizard+forms UI.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213349 </b>Popup&#160;message upon completing Data Entry is incorrect. This was fixed by backing out a change to another CSS.<br />Areas Impacted: Popup message when Data Entry step is completed.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213680 </b> Link in Print App pop up was not displaying properly. This was fixed by adding a required element to the message toast to display HTML that is not on the other toasts.<br />Areas Impacted: Print App pop up message.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213737 </b> No products were shown for Canadian Provinces/Territories on new application view. With changes around product availability and non-sponsored, the logic to load products was no longer properly considering additional jurisdiction approvals. This was fixed. Removed code that was incorrectly assigning available jurisdictions and redundant code for loading products when no jurisdiction was specified. <br />Areas Impacted: New application logic for non-US jurisdictions and populating of available jurisdictions for product availability API.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Common Tags</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 209483 </b> Typo in common tags auto-completion list. PrimaryBeneficiar4y_TIN should be PrimaryBeneficiary4_TIN. This was fixed. <br />Areas Impacted: Common Tags.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213155 </b> Common tag list values were not generated in Forms in IE11 and Edge. This was fixed.<br />Areas Impacted: Common Tag List Values.</li>

        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Console</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 208094 </b> Transfer question issue. Overlapping Fields where hiding the validation red border even if the control was above the other field. This was fixed. Put the red border on the same layer as the Control, instead of being below all controls. <br />Areas Impacted: How the Form is displayed on edit application for the console. Validation red border can now be on top of form fields.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Consumer Portal (D2C)</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213850 </b> Screen not positioned to top after navigation. A change to prepare for an upcoming React update resulted in the window scroll top behavior not being triggered when the user changed pages. This was fixed. Added a check to determine if the user changes pages, at which point the scroll top behavior is triggered.<br />Areas Impacted: Consumer Portal root.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213854 </b> Review checkbox on Review and Sign screen cannot be selected. A change to prepare for an upcoming React update resulted in the checked behavior not being handled properly for the "I have reviewed and agree..." checkbox. This was fixed. Changed update behavior of sign review to ensure checked behavior is correct.<br />Areas Impacted: Consumer Portal review and sign screen.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213855 </b> Scroll bar is not working. Slider position was being reset to its original value on every update of the component. This was fixed. Updated the slider so the position is reset only if a new value is received from its parent.<br />Areas Impacted:&#160;Wizard slider.</li>

With delayed 103, party info from the 103 is used if user does not clear the use party info checkbox when creating a copy with changes application. This was fixed. Removed the checkbox with the use party info for the delayed 103 party if the activity is being created from a source application. Patched Production 12/13/2019.<br />Areas&#160;Impacted: Copy with changes and Next Activity application creation.<br /></li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 209362, 213562, 214042 </b> Unused data items were not cleared on Copy with Changes. When copying an application with changes, DataItemIDs and values are being stored, even if the DataItemID does not exist in the new application/product. There were problems with data items not being removed because the removal didn't consider the new application forms and with data items being removed that were on excluded forms in the application, which were later included due to rule execution. These issues were fixed. Modified the copy application logic to: (1) Process removing of unused data items after initializing and running rules in the model and with the current form definitions.  Previously, processing occurred before rules ran and based on the original application forms. (2) Only consider data items that do not exist on any form in the application (whether included or not).  Previously, it considered data items that do not exist on any included form in the application. (3)&#160;Clear the value instead of removing, since the rules engine has already initialized its data item list.<br />Areas Impacted: Copying of applications (as-is and with changes), Save As, and custom action CopyApp workflows (see iConnect 214042) in legacy forms and combined wizard+form UI.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 210401 </b> Copied application incorrectly audited as being linked to source application. The previous version  introduced an audit when linking one activity to another, but it was incorrectly writing the audit on application creation based on whether there was a source activity, not on whether an application link was actually created.  So an audit of a link activity was getting created on application copy even though no link was actually being created. This was fixed. Moved the logic to audit creating of the link to when creating the application relation gets created. Also created a migration script to remove the invalid audits. <br />Areas Impacted: application copy as is and with changes, and also creating of new applications in various workflows (for instance, next activity and possibly others).</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214106 </b> Fast process is broken. CMR 202565 (clear Provider when copy with changes is used) was removing all Provider data items on Copy with Changes, and exclusion logic was not taking effect. This was fixed.

In forms, the  "to" and "from" data items were not consistently implemented in some of the email templates to auto-fill while you type.  Also, there was random behavior among email templates with the auto-fill capability that was causing the entire first line to be replaced instead of just the  "to" and "from" data items, which could delete important information. The Client Fill email requests, Send Email Requests during Signing Ceremony, and Send Email Delivery Method during Tele-Sign email templates have been updated to not auto-fill the "to" and "from" data items as you type. Because of the inconsistency of the auto-fill implementation, it was decided to remove the auto-fill behavior from the email templates that had it, and instead show the variable tag.

Added more robust update tracking to ensure all field update calls are complete before attempting to load a page.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard page load and field update.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 205767 </b> Tabbing in Wizards did not bypass read only fields. The tab system was not looking at the read only property on fields when setting the tab index property for Wizards. This was fixed. <br />Areas Impacted: Dropdown lists, date pickers, text boxes and checkboxes are the field types with the read only property. These field types in a wizard should be tested.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 210442 </b> Custom Lists in Wizard UI were showing the &lt;br&gt; and should not be. Wizard custom list element did not display HTMLl.  Provider generated list contained elements. This was fixed by allowing wizard custom lists to display HTMLl.<br />Areas Impacted: Custom list element list display.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 210771 </b> Google Address lookup was not pre-filling the State TC value with the combined forms/wizard UI. This was fixed. Updated the wizard mapper to add data group property to combo boxes from forms. <br />Areas Impacted: Google Address lockup in the combined forms/wizard UI.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 211309 </b> Other Actions/Documents is Missing (NOTE: Supplemental documents must be in PDF format and no larger than 20 MB.) from UI. Supplemental Documents was Not added to Wizard. This was fixed by adding the message, "NOTE: Supplemental documents must be in PDF format and no larger than 20 MB." to the document upload dialog in the combined wizard/forms UI.<br />Areas Impacted: Document Upload on Wizards.<br /></li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 211810 </b> Wizard Read Only checkboxes can still be checked/unchecked with spacebar. Removed key events on read only from the checkbox. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizard UI. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 212842 </b> QENext Error message inconsistency. Error messages were often overlapping or hidden by other elements within the Firelight UI. This was fixed. For the issue with overlapping messages on fields that are close together, there are a couple of options: (1) added an Error Placement property to Wizard fields, which allows error placement to be set within the Wizard Designer, (2) for radio buttons and checkboxes that have the same data item ID, clients can use the NoPopup option in the postmessage rule. This will still show the field in an error state, but will suppress the popup message. For the latest z-index issue, when the navigation buttons are not fixed to the bottom of the screen, the field validator popups should have a higher z-index than the buttons so the popups display in front of the buttons, which was not happening. This was fixed by adjusting the z-index of navigation buttons so they only display in front of field validator popups when the navigation buttons have been fixed to the bottom of the screen. <br />Areas Impacted: Wizard Designer, Wizard UI, Wizard navigation buttons.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213125 </b> Amount masks not functioning as expected. This was resolved by fixing issues with numeric field masks.<br />Areas Impacted: Fields with numeric field masks.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213126 </b> Zip code mask. Zip code mask didn't require 5 digits first before the dash. This was fixed.<br />Areas Impacted: Fields with Zip code masks.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213159 </b> Comment Box Does Not Apply to All Pages in Wizard. This was fixed. Moved logic to add floating text boxes out of the entire application and made it specific to each wizard per expectation.<br />Areas Impacted: Comment Box in Wizards.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214064 </b> Buttons to page back and forth between pages no Longer display Next or Previous. Text was incorrectly populating from the Page Name rather than the Navigation Text property.  This was fixed by removing code to use the correct serialized property.<br />Areas Impacted: Page navigation button text.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214335 </b> SSN validation rule with partial formatting is not working. SSN fields in wizards were running rules after obscuring text, so SSNs wouldn't match correctly to the same regex as forms. This was fixed by obscuring text after rules run.<br />Areas Impacted: Form fields with SSN formulas sent that are in a package with a wizard.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 214347 </b> Wizard - Issue with dropdown when add item dynamically and set value conditionally. If the field that is used to set the dynamic dropdown control is on a different page than the dropdown and is on a form in a wizard package, the dropdown will not update on page turn, but on refreshing the page or re-opening the activity. This was resolved. The dataitem holding the values for the dynamic dropdown needed to be added to the collection of dataitems for the page of the dropdown control for forms converted to wizard.<br />Areas Impacted: Dataitems created at initialization of the form in wizards.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214478 </b> Wizard - custom Upload and Print buttons display error when clicked. A previous change to resolve an issue with data item values not being incremented properly on custom action button calls resulted in an exception being thrown when custom action buttons were nested within panels or groups on a wizard. This was fixed by modifying data item value update logic to properly handle nested custom action buttons.<br />Areas Impacted: Calls to server using custom action buttons.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214793 </b> Date Picker not disabling with setcontrolstate on form fields in wizard data entry. Users could not disable the Calendar component. This was fixed. Patched Production 12/13/2019.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizards Calendar component. </li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214793 </b> Date Picker not disabling with setcontrolstate on form fields in wizard data entry. Users could not disable the Calendar component. This was fixed. Patched Production 12/13/19.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizards Calendar component.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214794 </b> Cannot navigate between Wizards within the Wizard Designer. The logic used to control floating comment box text box setup in the wizard designer was not functioning properly when changing between wizards, which resulted in script errors being thrown. This was fixed. Added checks to ensure floating comment box setup doesn't attempt to render in the middle of changing between wizards. Patched Production 12/13/2019.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard Designer.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214820 </b> Custom Lists in the Wizard UI are throwing a 500 error. The wizard implementation of custom lists expected the column names to contain a colon (:) character, storing the text after that in a Columns property.  When the colon didn't exist, an exception occurred. This was fixed by modifying the code to use a blank string for the Columns values if the column names do not contain a colon. Patched Production 12/13/2019.<br />Areas Impacted: Custom Lists in Wizards UI.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 215132 </b> Read only field with mask is showing editable when both form and wizard are used in the same package. Masked fields were ignoring read-only status. This was fixed. Copied and converted masking library to typescript, updated library to ignore most keystrokes and inputs when read only is selected.<br />Areas Impacted: Any masked fields, as well as datepickers (wizard only)</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 215142 </b> Locked wizard can be edited and is not saved. This was fixed. A locked wizard can now only be edited and saved by the person that locked it.  Any other user that opens the wizard in the designer will see the red message that it's locked by the person that locked it and the Save button is not available.<br />Areas Impacted: Editing of wizards, wizard locking</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 215349 </b> Wizard - Warning/Error icon showing on dropdown when no error exists on form. Warning/Error icon on the pages in the forms drop-down showing up when there are not any visible warnings/errors on the page. This seems to be due to validation rules and field masking—the validation message goes away immediately after the full SSN is entered, but reappears when refreshed/reloaded. Possibly the form (no error) and the form list (showing red) are not in sync due to this. This was fixed by hiding the values using the format list after rules run so rules can still process things like SSN result. Patched v2.16 Production 1/10/2020.<br />Areas Impacted: Validation rules and field masking.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 215698 </b> First CanSell Message Not Working for Wizards. For specifically wizards, any results for a CanSell check from the provider was not being displayed. This was fixed. Put in logic to set the Wizard model's CanSell property, which gets forwarded to the UI to display the message. Patched Prod 1/10/2020.<br />Areas Impacted: Edit Wizard area</li>
