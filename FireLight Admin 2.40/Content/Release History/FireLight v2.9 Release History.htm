                <h2>Enhancements</h2>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Barcode Enhancement</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 144590 </b> Barcode Enhancements - Make barcode available in datamatrix format, as well as able to include on PDF &#160;– In FireLight Admin, added a Barcode Type field to the field properties for Barcode controls with options of QR Code or Datamatrix. Datamatrix type is always visible in the application during all phases of the application process (data entry, e-sign, submission) and it is visible online and in the pdf/printed version.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Fees and Expenses Repository</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR <a href="../Resources/DesignDocs/150568-FeesAndExpenseRepositoryDesignApproach.pdf" target="_blank" title="Design Document" alt="Design Document">150568</a></b> DOL Fees and Expense repository &#160;– In FireLight, added a repository to house the
fees, expenses, and commissions data for clients. FireLight will receive the data for the repository
from the DTCC and/or direct from the carrier. Distributors using data from the DTCC

must be licensed to use the DTCC data. In addition, carriers can upload the files directly to
FireLight.  There is a licensing component for both the carriers and distributors to support this feature.  
Carrier clients interested in participating should contact their Strategic Account Manager for Work Order pricing.  Distributors will need to work with their Strategic Account Manager for pricing and submit their fees and expense disclosures along with a work order to tag the disclosure document to their PM and Product Management as soon as possible .
 Carriers is required to tag their applications with data items for each Rider that will have a fee and set the export value to match the PPfA. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Groups </b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 153453 </b>Define a default external role code if none specified so that permissions can be restricted. &#160;– Changed base to assign an external role code of DEFAULT if none is provided.  Then, an organization could create a group with that TC code and configure its rights for users that login without an external role code.  If no such group code is defined, it will operate the same as it does today with no group options checked, maintaining backward compatibility. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Needs Determination</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR <a href="../Resources/DesignDocs/147396-DesignApproachForNeedsDetermination.pdf" target="_blank" title="Design Document" alt="Design Document">147396</a><![CDATA[  ]]></b> DOL New Transaction Type for Needs Determination &#160;– Added a new Needs Determination transaction type for collecting the client data needed to make a Best Interest Recommendation.  This new transaction sits in front of the application and supports launching from the Needs Determination transaction to the application.  The transaction has its own audit report, output, and reporting. To support this feature, there is a licensing component for the distributors and for forms tagging. Distributors will need to work with the VP of Distribution sales, Steven Acosta, for pricing.  Determine the types of Needs Determination workflows for your organization and submit a Work Order with your Strategic Account Manager to update your SSO, applicable database tables and rules for your organization and for any custom Upload button work, etc.  </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR <a href="../Resources/DesignDocs/147397_ProductFilterDesign_Approach_2-17-2017.pdf" target="_blank" title="Design Document" alt="Design Document">147397</a></b> DOL Filter capabilities from the Needs Determination to the Application  – In FireLight Admin, added a Needs Filter tab on the Groups page in Profiles. Distribution enters product category filter criteria with the dataitems from the needs questionnaire that is used to filter the available products to select in the application. FireLight uses the filter criteria defined for a product to narrow down the available product options.  For example: Accumulation, Income, Protection, Death Benefit, and Protection of Capital can be set as product categories on products available to BD1.  When the Needs Determination or a pre-filled SSO identifies one of the defined categories, the products listed for selection will only show the products that meet that criteria. Distributor licensing is required to support this feature. Distributors need to work with the VP of Distribution sales, Steven Acosta, for pricing. Additionally, each client needs to submit a Work Order to define their specific filter criteria for the products on their shelf. This needs to be done in conjunction with your Needs Determination questionnaire or SSO. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Organizations</b>
                </p>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 155988 </b>SAML SSO - support multiple IDP Identifiers per organization. &#160;– Added support for multiple IDP identifiers separated by commas (no spaces) in the SAML SSO, for example: IDP_Identifier1,IDP_Identifier2,IDP_Identifier3. Add the IDP Identifier(s) on the Organizations page in Profiles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Products</b>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 153833 </b>Add Group Annuity to Product Type &#160;– In FireLight Admin, Profiles, added Group Annuity to the Product Type field on the Products page.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 135771 </b> Organization name for products &#160;In FireLight Admin on the Products page, added a new Product Organization Name field to add the selling carrier organization name for the product. FireLight users will see the selling carrier organization name for each product when creating a new application. If the Product Organization Name field is left blank, it will default to the Organization Name on the Organizations page in Admin.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 149569 </b>Data item value has wrong value. This has been fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 149987 </b>FireLight will not redirect to our website. When exiting from FireLight, the user was being routed back to the FireLight login page instead of being redirected to the organization's website. This has been fixed. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 152270 </b>Check Box export value is ignored. Firelight would only recognize "true" as the value for a Check Box control even if something else had been entered. This was fixed and then rolled back. Check box export values will always be set to "true." Use radio button controls when export values are needed. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 152790 </b>Unable to keep Assigned Package in desired order. This has been fixed. Distributor packages can now be placed before and after carrier packages.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 152846 </b>Empty initial is allowed. This has been fixed. FireLight no longer accepts white space for an initial. </li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 155358 </b>Template forms when combined with Link allowing a user to download their completed apps. After submitting an application, Template forms  were also being included in the forms to download  list. This has been fixed. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 155868 </b> Fees and Expense Repository not overwriting old PPfA. This has been fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 156142 </b>Repository: 2 RiderTypeCodes with the same number but different FeatureOptProduct.ProductCode options is not working. This has been fixed.</li>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 149903 </b>Validate and limit purge policy settings    – In FireLight Admin on the Organizations page in Profiles, the number of days allowable before purge of uncompleted applications must be between 30 and 180 days and the number of days allowable before purge of completed applications must be between 10 and 180 days.</li>

The signature controls on the template form in FireLight Admin is replaced by the signature controls of the uploaded document. See CMR 147003 in iConnect for additional documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR          126897 </b>  Update user interface to indicate that Review Queue script is an organization setting. In FireLight Admin on the Review Queue page in Profiles, added "NOTE: The review queue script is global to all queues and is deployed using Organization Configuration." below the Edit Review Queue Script link.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 147711 </b>Node Help: Get Set/getcustomlist    – In FireLight Admin, the node help for &lt;getcustomlist&gt; had a bad example. This has been fixed. </li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 148371 </b>Exclude FLI_ data items from count for test conditions    – In FireLight regression testing, a well known FLI global data item was added to all applications. When the test was run, it failed because of the one more data item. This has been fixed. Now the number of data items condition does not count pre-defined (FLI_) global data items so they will not cause existing benchmarks to fail. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 148779 </b>Issue with CRM 114027 - System Error with Decline ESign    – When the value of FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN was null, an error occurred. This is related to DR 149049 and has been fixed.  </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 149049 </b>Exception saving application when FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN data item is non-boolean value    – When the value of FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN was set to "Yes" (a non-boolean value), it prevented the application from being saved. This has been fixed. Changed the base system so that if a non-null/empty value that cannot be converted to a boolean value is encountered, it is treated as "false" rather than causing an error condition. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR          149130 </b>  Read-only calendar fields producing dropdowns in odd places. This has been fixed.</li>

In FireLight Admin on the Organizations page in Profiles, added a new Allow Client Fill &amp; Sign checkbox to turn on the feature. On the Designer page in Field Properties, added a new Office Use Only checkbox to be selected (checked) for any form fields that the agent is required to fill in. In FireLight, pages with required agent entry fields are indicated with a darker pink background and "Office Use Only" text in the Form Entry validation list for the application.

Workflow is based on replacement requirements passed in the file. For example, if the ceding carrier will not accept eSignature on the ACORD 951 form, then we do not allow eSignature on the order.  Cooperative Technology is responsible for contracting directly with the clients.  We are simply providing the integration to support our clients.</li>

Clients should use the new pre-tagged and updated ACORD 951 eForm because it has added tags for the ceding carrier data and the new button. Contact the Forms team to get the form.

Added a new common tag, FLI_DECLINED_ESIGN that can be null/empty, true or false. If set to null or empty, the process will run as usual. If set to true, the e-signature process is skipped and the next defined step will take place. If set to false, the user will have to accept the e-signature process.

The original design of the client fill request was for an admin/home office function which is why the protection property was not honored.  Over the past few releases we have added new features that can be used to share applications in a home office environment that work better and is more efficient.  Because of that, client fill and sign should only be used for client requests and the form protection should be honored.  <b>This is a change to the use case around this feature.
