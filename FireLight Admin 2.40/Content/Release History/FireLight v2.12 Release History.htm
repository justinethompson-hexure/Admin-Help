                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">1035YellowPages</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 185303 </b> Updated FireLight to pull back the business street address from 1035YellowPages.com as default instead of pulling back the mailing address as default. If the street address is not found, FireLight pulls back the first address provided.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Integration</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 185353 </b>  Enhanced FireLight base to pass dataitems to integration on integration initialization.  Providers that Clear Mapped Data will have to remove it to prevent losing passed in dataitems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Product Types</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 181617 </b> Added a new Pre Sale Suitability Review product type to FireLight.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fixed Defects</h2>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Admin</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 182381 </b> Delete Rule tooltip did not disappear until navigating away from the page. Also, the message asking if the user wanted to overwrite changes was appearing when only one user was in the rule set. User had to cancel Save to close the message. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182565 </b> Saving of rule sets was taking too long. This was fixed by making a change in the application firewall and by fixing the 'user has changed rule set' error by disabling the ability to click Save while the system is in process of saving a rule set. </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184056 </b> Rules were not being reset for the search option in packages until either the package rules were saved or the search cleared. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184958 </b> Deployments page did not clearly state the timezone that is used for scheduled deployments. This was fixed by changing the name of the "Schedule Deployment at" box to Schedule Deployment at (Mountain Time). </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185197 </b> If a custom CRM was configured, it was not possible for the organization to also use a Redtail CRM. This was fixed. Enter a CRM Parameter of Redtail to specify Redtail CRM. Patched UAT/Staging/Production 7/17/2018.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 186328 </b> Unable to access rule sets to set approved states. Audit records were being written for all rules in a rule set regardless of whether they were changed, which was causing a timeout while loading the rule set. This was fixed by adding a check to ensure audit records are only written for rules that have changed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 186715 </b> A Standard email template was being sent when a Branded email template should have been sent. This was fixed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Applications</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 181970 </b> New applications incorrectly had an override date defined when they should not. This was fixed. Patched Production 8/7/18.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184640 </b> Input-only pdfs were showing up in the external signature process, and should not have been. This was fixed by adding a check to ensure document visibility was taken into account for external signature pdf viewing.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184835 </b> An error occurred when entering the signing ceremony if the application had e-sign declined. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185343 </b> Product Type drop-down list on the new application view should be sorted alphabetically. This was fixed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Check Boxes</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184204 </b> Check boxes were not allowing users to select multiple checkboxes and were functioning like radio buttons. This was fixed by updating the system to check for an empty group name in a checkbox. If the group name is empty, the system only updates that checkbox. Otherwise, the system updates all items in the group.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Client Sign Request</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 184640 </b> Input-only PDFs were showing up in external signature process, and should not have been. This was fixed by adding in a check to make sure document visibility was taken into account for external signature PDF viewing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185368 </b> Requests dialog was showing the signature request was complete when it was not complete. This was fixed. Now the dialog will not show the signature request is complete until all document sets have been signed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Combo Boxes</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 183346 </b>  Rolled back the fix for this as it introduced a new bug. Initial default values of combo boxes are being set to an empty value when the dropdown options do not contain an empty option. The previous resolution was to set the dropdown value to the default option (1st option) if the value is empty. Because the combo control is updated with a value, but the data item is still blank, the combo displays a value, but a required rule on the field generates a validation message, since the data item is empty. This is working as expected and is not a bug.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">CRM and Commission Lookups</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 187121 </b> CRM lookups and commission options selection were not populating the information in applications. A bug was introduced in the UAT release on 8/17/2018. This was fixed. Patched UAT 9/6/2018. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Document Upload</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185267 </b> When uploading a document template, the selected document type in the combo box did not always match the internal document type of the document being uploaded. This was fixed. Patched UAT/Staging/Production 7/17/2018.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">DTCC Codes</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185200 </b> Updated to DTCC September 2018 spreadsheet and added new DTCC Codes (RI - RIA and AP - Authorized Party) to FireLight base.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">FireLight Console</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182763 </b> For a checked out application on the Console, client information such as SS# and name was not pre-filled on the applications. This was fixed by adding new rule nodes to the Console and having the Console update the dataitem of current form location on page update.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184442 </b> Console was repeatedly bringing up e-signature forms to sign. The document set was repeating because it did not know it was complete. This was fixed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Needs Determination</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 176881 </b> After completing a Needs Determination, Firelight was preventing users from selecting another product after navigating to a Product Type that had no products in it. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 186387 </b> In the application workflow, the Needs Determination PDF file was not being included in the application Documents list. This was fixed.</li>

This was fixed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Wizards</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 185111 </b> In wizard fields that had diset rules, fields would not repopulate with the default value when the user entered blank in the field. The user had to go to another page and return to the field for the field to repopulate with the default value. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 186850 </b> Conditional forms with enabled signature controls were not added to the signing ceremony for wizard products. This was fixed.</li>

In FireLight Admin in  Profiles/Groups/App tab, added the "Enable Auto Submit" and "Enable Auto Submit Email Notification" role code options.

                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 181472 </b> In wizards, rules were not running on an invalid or unformatted date. This was fixed. Modified the date picker control to send all values when the user navigates off the control, even if the value is not a valid date.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182176 </b> In the wizard designer, setcomboitems rules did not work (they would not replace or append). This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182382 </b> Saving of Mappings was not working. This was fixed. Applied database change to QE, UAT, Staging, and Production 5/15/2018.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182397 </b> Mappings were not showing up for deployment after saving. This was fixed by updating the timestamp when saving or deleting mappings. Also updated button captions to be plural to indicate that all mappings is saved/deleted.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182487 </b> In the wizard designer, wizard pages were getting deleted when adding new items to previous pages. This was fixed by modifying the page selection dropdown change handler. Patched UAT 5/17/18.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182612 </b> The setpackagestatebyname rule caused an exception if a form had the "Will Be Replaced By" property set. The real problem is the logic that loads package names for the application forms does not take into account forms that are replaced by another form, leading to the exception due to a null package name. A workaround is to use "This Form Expires On" property for the  form to be replaced and use "This Form Begins On" property for the new form instead of using the "Will Be Replaced By" property.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182769 </b> Include source organization and environment in deployment notification emails. This was completed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182809 </b> In the wizard designer, if a date picker or dropdown was placed next to a text box, the fields did not align properly. This was fixed by changing the CSS class. Patched UAT 5/25/18.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 183169 </b> In Profiles/Email, the Branding Firm option  was not working correctly when there was no locale. This was fixed.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 183771 </b> In the Rules window for the form designer and the Rules window for the wizard designer, the Yes and No buttons were in reverse order in the save rule set confirmation dialog. This was fixed. Now the Yes button is on the left and the No button is on the right for both save rule set confirmation dialoges.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 184746 </b> Distributor organizations could not save sales agreements that had a Start and/or End date because the Time Zone, Start, End and Replaced Product fields were not being posted to the server. This was fixed.</li>

                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
                </p>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182962 </b> The rule editor dialog would randomly close without providing any error information. Fixed server-side error handling within the wizard designer and rule editor so the user is provided with the proper information and dialogs are not closed improperly.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 183969 </b> Filter by Activity type, Status and Sort were missing in UAT. This was fixed in the code to prevent this and added a migration script to prevent this from happening in Staging and Production.</li>

The application was being rolled back to locked status due to the conflicting settings of the distributor's environment and the carrier's for the Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline option.   This was fixed. The app will now be set to submitted rather than rolled back to locked in the case where the application is transmitted through the carrier when their Allow Submit on E-Sign Decline option is turned on and the distributor's setting is off.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 182243 </b> Client data for delayed 103 was being saved off, but was not populating the form fields.

                        <p>Beginning with FireLight v2.12, we updated the styling for the Home page because we needed to adjust the layout of the Home page to support all of the new activities. Based on feedback from clients, we made some additional changes to the Home page so that if you enable 3 activities or less the Home buttons will stack vertically like they did in v2.11.  Once you exceed 3 activities, the Home buttons will shift to a two-buttons-per-row layout that you see today in v2.12.</p>
                        <p>You do also have the ability to customize the icons on the home page.  We now support the usage of Font Awesome but can also include custom images if you had custom images defined in 2.11. More details about font awesome can be found on their website, <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/" target="_blank">https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/</a></p>
