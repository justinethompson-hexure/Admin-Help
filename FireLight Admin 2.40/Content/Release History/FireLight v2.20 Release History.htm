When there is null data, it was resulting in a null reference exception, which would get logged and handled, but the exception information wasn't very useful. Resolution: Modified the service to check for null data and populate empty data in the request/response instead of failing on a null reference.  If the request data is incomplete, the service will return an   error, which can be displayed to the user.  Also commented out some code that was processing some response data that is not currently used. NOTE: This iConnect replaces 247088 &amp; 247093, which are being addressed through forms/rules changes.<br></br>Areas Impacted: LexisNexis service</p>

The migration process introduced a bug that did not take into account that a user can be part of multiple organizations. This caused data to be corrupt and has been resolved. Problem: The conversion of user firm ID (from being stored in the 1228 to being stored as a column in the database, a change needed to support multiple firm IDs for a user -- iConnect 233321) was not correctly handling users that exist in multiple organizations.  The user's firm ID was being updated (for all organizations) to the firm ID that user had in the last processed organization instance. Resolution: Fixed the conversion of the firm ID to be organization-specific.  Also corrected the logic to remove multiple instances of a user's firm ID to be specific to the current organization (this was also global and could result in the user's records in other organizations being deleted when removing multiple instances of a firm ID for a user).<br></br>Areas Impacted: Access conversion of user firm IDs and deleting of multiple instances of user firmIDs</p>

Problem: The audit message for LexisNexis custom action is being written as "System_AuditMessage_ThirdPartyWebService_LexisNexis_CustomAction," due to a hard-code message template of "ThirdPartyWebService_LexisNexis_CustomAction" which doesn't exist. Resolution: Removed the incorrect message identifier, to use the default message template key of "MSG_ThirdParyWebService_LexisNexis_CustomAction," resulting in the correct audit message template of "FireLight made a web service call on behalf of {0} to LexisNexis for the {1} in the activity {2}."

Problem: Combo Box controls were getting rendered on the PDF as an editable Combo Box, where text and values were listed as items. The first item was displayed as selected, which would usually be the incorrect item. A label that cannot be edited is what should be rendered to the PDF. Resolution: An area of code was refactored in 2.20 and was not correctly removing fields from the document. The code was changed back so the fields were removed correctly and the issue has been resolved.<br />Areas Impacted: This is visible when rendering the PDF from a Form that has a Combo Box. This is likely an issue across many PDFs.</p>

Validation messages are not displayed for disabled fields, and when a disabled field is encountered, child fields of that field are not processed for validation messages that would be added to the a) error list and b) included in % complete.  (The validation message is still displayed on the field itself since it is handled differently). Resolution: When processing validation messages for the error list and % complete, include enabled children of disabled fields. Also, page maps could still be created with inaccurate error information, and the total number of controls in the application (used for percent complete) was ignoring enabled children of disabled panels/groups. These have been changed to ignore disabled state for panels/groups and continue to check the child fields for errors.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard UI</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It was not anticipated that the same data items would be used in multiple field hierarchies, and children of a field in other hierarchies would not be enabled/disabled with the changes for iConnect 240231 (this is not a bug).  One workaround for the above issue is to avoid using duplicate data items in multiple locations.</p>

        <h2>2.20.192 April 9, 2021 Production Release</h2>
        <h2>Known Issue</h2>
        <p>This affects the combined wizard + forms UI, when a wizard (actually any wizard within the activity) has multiple fields on different panels or pages with the same data item (i.e., MY_DATA_ITEM).  If one instance is in a chain of descendant controls where a parent field is disabled via a rule, with the implementation of iConnect 240231, this will now disable all children of that parent, including the one with data item MY_DATA_ITEM, and this will also disable any other instances of field with data item MY_DATA_ITEM on the wizard (because it’s the data item itself that becomes disabled), but not its descendant controls / data items in the other instances.  When this occurs, such descendant fields will still be enabled and could have validation messages, but those messages will not count toward % complete or be shown in the error list.  The workaround is to not use the same data item for multiple fields in different sections of any wizard within the activity.</p>

Assistive technology is also negatively impacted as a result of web content that does not conform to defined accessibility guidelines. There are three levels of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliance: A, AA and AAA. The levels of accessibility are broken down into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust (POUR).

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When DocuSign is enabled, the Signature Audit will not be captured within the FireLight Signing audit, however FireLight is receiving a signature audit back from DocuSign that is attached to the application and sent within the client's payload.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>FireLight will need the signed documents with the digital signature applied and the DocuSign signature audit returned 100% complete to FireLight.  The clients that need DocuSign implemented have the DocuSign digital signature, tamper evidence and audit approved.</p>

If you have set your organization support email address to a corporate email address, you probably also updated the SPF record on your domain to include the IP Addresses of the email servers used by FireLight.  You will need to have your network team add to your SPF record the IP address SendGrid will use to send email on behalf of FireLight.  The SendGrid IP Address is 168.245.13.50.  We do suggest that you keep the existing IP address within your SPF record you have set up for FireLight in case we need to roll back to our legacy email code. We are also planning on keeping our current mail server(s) and will use it as a back up to SendGrid in case we ever run into problems that require us not to use SendGrid.  We recommend sharing this information with your network team so that they are aware of this change.</p>

Within FireLight today, a user is not able to retain comments within reviewer documents from one queue to another unless a workaround is placed within the Provider. For this enhancement, comments made on any reviewer document will need to be retained throughout each sequential review queue that it is associated with.  Even though these comments will still be editable across each queue, the next reviewer is able to view them within the queue that they are assigned, which allows for a more convenient user experience. Additionally, if an application is rejected, then these reviewer documents will need to be retained, especially if the user would want to recall that rejection.

Once closed, there is no clear way to recover that message. If the message states that there is a specific action required by the user and that message was closed without having been read and acknowledged by the user, it leaves the user without that information and without a way to re-trigger that information.

Form field shading in wizard and form combination packages. Currently, different behavior is observed in the coloring of enabled fields in forms; depending on the composition of the package in which the forms appear. If the package includes only forms, the shading of enabled fields is yellow. If the package includes a combination of forms and wizards, enabled fields appear without shading. The scenario where this can occur when carriers utilizing form deploy to distributor environments utilizing wizards. It should be noted that required fields (shaded in red) is currently consistent regardless of package configuration and this will not change. <p>The shading of enabled fields on forms is a significant usability issue because of the number of fields that may be present on any one page of a form. Forms could have as many as 50-80 enabled fields on a given page.
