        </p>
        <p>Currently, if search items used in an email template have a blank or null value, they are not replaced in the emails sent to the users.

        </p>
        <p>We improved the logic for determining user permissions to make it more consistent. For external authentication (design, client fill, fill and sign request, concierge user workflows, etc.), always utilize the permissions of the EXTERNAL role code/group if defined, or fall back to the owning agent's role code/group permissions. For SSO and direct logins with no role code or an invalid role code (or external logins with no EXTERNAL group defined), use the DEFAULT role code/group if defined.
