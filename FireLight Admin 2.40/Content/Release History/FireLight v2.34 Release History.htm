        <h3>Increase the File Size Limit of Single File Upload Up to 50 MB</h3>
        <p>With this enhancement, the file size for attachments to activities has been increased.   The maximum available file size is now 50 MB. The maximum file size for your organization can be set in the FireLight administration tool. The feature can enable users to upload large files (up to 50 MB) without splitting them into multiple files.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FL Admin &gt; Organization Config &gt; Organization Setting &gt; Activity (tab) &gt; Maximum Upload File Size - Single (dropdown)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>FL App &gt; Activity &gt; Other Actions (menu) &gt; Documents (upload dialog)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Impact of Changes to Sales Agreement/Product Availability</h3>
        <p>With this enhancement, an agent will not be able to submit an application (unlocked) for which the sales agreement is no longer valid. Currently, an agent cannot create an application for an invalid/expired sales agreement, but if the sales agreement became invalid while the application was not yet locked (in data entry), the agent is still able to continue to signature and submit the application. With this enhancement, when the agent tries to continue/submit an application in data entry, with an invalid sales agreement, FL will provide an alert and make the application read-only. They would still be allowed to submit a locked application.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>App: When an agent loads an activity in “Data Entry” with an invalid sales agreement, an alert will appear, disallowing the agent to proceed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Enhancement for Custom Activity Pop-up Messages</h3>
        <p>This enhancement allows suppressing pop-up message for an activity action. The FireLight Administration Tool User can save a blank message for an activity action so that no alert appears for that action within the FireLight workflow.  The default system message can be restored to enable the system alerts.</p>
        <p>With this enhancement, admin users can also place links in the custom alert messages for activity action.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>FL Admin &gt; Product Config &gt; Activities &gt; Activity Details (tab) &gt; Edit Activity Pop-up Messages (link)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Allow saving blank message for an activity action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Allow using workflow links to activity custom pop-up messages.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Manage Form Protection for Sign-Only Duty Types</h3>
        <p>With this enhancement, Agent and Client protection on forms are applied to the duty types related to signing. Both the protections will apply when printing and signing these forms.</p>
        <p>A client protected form will not be available to an agent for printing and signing unless agent signatures are required. Similarly, an agent protected will not be available to a client for print and signing unless client signatures are required.</p>
        <p>Both of these protections are applicable to the following duty types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Signing Ceremony Only</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signing Ceremony Only: Conditional</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signing Ceremony Only: All</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signing Ceremony Only: All Conditional</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Print Only</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Agent and Client UI for App: Other Actions &gt; Display/Print PDF</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Agent and Client UI for App: Activity &gt; Signatures</p>
