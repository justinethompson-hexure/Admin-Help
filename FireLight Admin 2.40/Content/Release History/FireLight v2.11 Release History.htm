                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Disability Income Product Types</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 176638 </b> Added the Disability Income Conversion and Disability Income Increase product types  to FireLight.</li>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 180598 </b> Added the ability to brand the email templates for sub firms on the Email page.  To add branding for sub firm emails, contact your Strategic Account Manager to have the FireLight team create the list of Branding Firms for you. Once that list is created, you can manage the sub firm emails on your own by selecting an email template and then selecting a sub firm in the Branding Firm list on the Email page. NOTE: Organizations that currently have Branding Firms have had their Branding Firm list created in their environments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Global Data Items</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 173296 </b> When the organization setting for Allow E-Approval (manual PreSubmit review) was selected and the FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW global data item was set to "false" and the user clicked the Continue button, the user was still seeing the sub menu with the "Request Review" and "Submit" options. This was updated. Now when the organization setting for Allow E-Approval  is selected and the FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW data item is set to "false," the system will not show the Review step or the sub menu with the "Request Review" and "Submit" options. When the organization setting for Allow E-Approval  is selected and FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW is set to "true," FireLight takes the user directly to the PreSubmit review process and does not show the sub menu with the "Request Review" and "Submit" options.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Localization</b>

                <ul>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">[CMR 148022 ]</b> Began adding components in v2.11 to improve support for multiple locales. In FireLight Admin, added: Localization dialog on the Organizations page, Product Locale list on the Products page, Locale list on the Email page. In FireLight e-Application, added a Locale list on the Preferences page. Full localization support with setup instructions is available in v2.12. </li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 177537 </b> In FireLight Admin, added two additional agent Signer Types, Fourth Agent and Fifth Agent, for signature and signature initials fields. </li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 164849 </b> Custom lists were not loading in distributor environments. A short term fix was implemented to use the application's product org ID to find the custom list if not found in the app org ID. Patched UAT and Staging 3/12/18 and rest of patch 3/13/18. Added one more fix for loading of lists from getcustomlist rule and patches UAT and Staging 3/20/2018.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 178559 </b> Unable to add new product. This was fixed. Patched UAT 3/6/18.</li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 178561 </b> Incorrect mapping for Funeral Firm Representative signer type. This was fixed. Now the mapping prefix is FLI_FUNERAL_FIRM_REP. Patched UAT 3/6/18.</li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 178137 </b> A purged application should NO longer link to the benchmark. This was fixed. Changed the Benchmark feature to not display a link to the original application if that application has been purged or deleted.</li>

                        <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 179474 </b>  After completing a needs determination package, a pop-up was stating that no product was available for the application. This was fixed. Now the pop-up does not show when products are still available to the agent (previously, it would show if there were no products listed for the given jurisdiction and/or product type selection). Patched UAT 4/6/2018.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 177945 </b> ZML needs determination applications filter was filtering both jurisdiction and product and causing difficulty getting back into the same jurisdiction and application after the suitability form was completed. This was fixed. Needs determination product filtering now removes product line where products are not available and no longer restricts jurisdiction if no products are available.

The new button names are 'Submit and logoff' and 'Save - Finish later'. 'Submit and logoff' saves the changes made to the application and completes the request, which prohibits the client from using the same URL link to come back in to make additional changes. 'Save - Finish later' allows the client to come back into the application and make additional changes.</li>

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">CMR 173234 </b> Only audit final request for Cooperative Technologies service calls instead of auditing every request.

                    <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 173463 </b> The Package Rules Report was not displaying all of the rules in the package. This was fixed. Now the Package Rules Report displays the package rule sets rather than the form rules within each package.</li>

The Fee Inquiry transaction type allows users with access to the new transaction type to query the selected product fee values and display them in a dynamic fee worksheet.  This transaction type is available via SSO and through manual selection of the Fee Inquiry transaction.  The fee inquiry transaction is a one-time view into the fees for the selected product.  The Fee Inquiry is not saved and will not be available in Recent History or All Applications.  The only actions available for this inquiry is print/download.  There are no other actions available including save, signatures, review, send to client, or submit. The fees can now be pulled based on the order of the data in the PPfA and do not require a static placeholder in the PDF.  Only the fees that are in the PPfA for the selected product is displayed which creates a more user friendly fee display.  To do this, the enhancement added a fee attribute called number (number="1" for the first fee, "2" for the second fee, etc.).  The Fees and Expense License or DOL License is required to support the new transaction.  If you are already licensed for the repository, there is no additional license and there are no transaction fees to use the inquiry. If you are not licensed, please contact your Strategic Account Manager for an addendum to your contract to support the repository.

Added the ability to group rules into rule sets and add the applicable rule sets to packages, which allows maximum reuse of the same rules across multiple packages. Rule sets provide beginning and expiration dates to assist with release planning.  Rules can be grouped into categories (distributor-specific rule set, owner rule set, product-specific rule set, etc.) so multiple users can each work on a different rule set at the same time and lock their rule set for editing to prevent overwriting. Rule sets can be deployed independently of forms. With the implementation of rule sets, FireLight converts all of your previous form level rules to rule sets with the rule set names matching the form names. In FireLight Admin, added the Rule Sets page in Profiles where users can do most of the rules work. FireLight continues to support the Rules Window in form Designer to manage rules associated with a selected control. In Admin Help, see the <MadCap:xref href="../Product Configuration/Rule Sets.htm">Rule Sets</MadCap:xref> page in Profiles for detailed information. <b>NOTE:</b> If you exported forms that had rules in FireLight v2.10 and need to import those forms back into FireLight, be sure to upload those forms with the <b>Use exported <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> definitions</b> checkbox selected before the move to FireLight v2.11 production.
