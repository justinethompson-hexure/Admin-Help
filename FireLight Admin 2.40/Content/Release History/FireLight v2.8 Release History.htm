                    <li><b class="DRnumber">[131123 / 137556] </b> Changes to the purge policy and reports – Added to the purge process the deletion of purged applications.  For applications that have a purge date and are not in Complete status, permanently delete the application when the last update is two times the Purge Uncompleted Days policy. Modified the policy to treat submitted applications the same as completed applications by including them in the Purge Completed Days policy rather than the Purge Uncompleted Days policy. Also modified the Pending Purge Apps report and added a new Pending Deletion report. The new Pending Deletion report lists completed/transmitted applications that is reaching the delete from database date (two times the Purge Completed Days policy). To get the new Pending Deletion Report, you need to submit a request to your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Strategic Account Manager.</li>
