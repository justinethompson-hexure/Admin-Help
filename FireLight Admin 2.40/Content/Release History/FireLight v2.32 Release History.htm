        <p>This enhancement adds a section to the data entry section of the Emailageaudit reports to verify information that was entered in that section of the application.</p>
        <h4>Impact:</h4>
        <p>•	Emailage integration</p>
        <p>•	Emailage audit reports</p>
        <p>New Inclusion Option</p>
        <p>We added the ability to create two new options for a form in a package: "Signing Ceremony Only: All" and "Signing Ceremony Only: All Conditional." These new options differ from "Signing Ceremony Only" versions in that the form is displayed to all users during the signing ceremony if a signature control is on it, as opposed to only the user whose signature needs to be collected.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Admin Packages: Form duty</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Signature Option: CS-12926</h3>
        <p>We added the ability to add two new group options in Admin, both on the App tab. The first option, Lock Signature Email Addresses, is under the Emails category. When that option is selected, when an agent sends a signature request, they will not be able to update/change the email address to which the request is sent. The second option, under the Signing: General category, is Hide Recipient Link for Agent. When this option is selected, the link the user uses to log in is displayed to the agent on the Signature Request screen.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Admin: Group Options</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signature Requests</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Replace ID Issue Jurisdiction Selection with Country Selection: iConnect 278642</p>
        <p>We have extended the ListProfile for ID verification to include an info node. This node is used to specify whether the issuing jurisdiction should be a Country or a Jurisdiction/State dropdown.</p>
        <p>Impact</p>
        <p>•	Client ID Verification</p>
        <h3>Work Groups Participation/Coordination (Intra Org)</h3>
        <p>We enabled intra organization workflows, allowing users to have shared visibility into an activity and receive notifications for the activity life cycle. This also allows multiple individuals to access an activity without being required to take a specific action, such as Transfer, Share, etc. Status and notification functionality is enhanced to add a list of individuals to receive notifications/have visibility of a single activity from start to finish, enabling a "Team Like" activity visibility.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>•	Admin: Organization, Admin tab: New group option</p>
        <p>•	Admin: Group Options, App tab: New Work Groups section</p>
        <p>•	Admin: Audits</p>
        <p>•	App: Communications</p>
        <p>•	App: Preferences</p>
        <h3>Updates to AURA Next Integration</h3>
        <p>We completed various updates to the integration with RGA AURA Next to complete the XML passed to AURA Next and update navigation data for button logic passed into the AURA Next User interface.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Update XML Content for Holding/Insured relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update Tracking ID to reflect application ID.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update JSON passed to AURA to correct navigation buttons.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
