                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 256732 </b> Multi-Life applications not submitting. Problem: Batch Async Methods have not been updated for new Factory Design. Resolution: Moved to Async Runner for async call. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Batch App Page</p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 264531 </b> Unable to Search by Policy Number in FireLight. Problem: If the FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER data item was set from a callexternal rule, if the data item did not already exist, it would not get created (the rule system requires all data items to be initialized when the activity is loaded). A workaround for now is to write a rule to initialize the data item on new activities. Resolution: Modified the base system to always initialize FLI_CONFIRMATION_NUMBER and FLI_APPLICATION_CONTROL_NUMBER data items to an empty string at app creation.  It was already clearing an existing value on a copy.  Extended the logic to create the data item if it doesn't exist.  So if it is updated in a callexternal rule, the change will take effect. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Existence of above data items on new activities</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 267543 </b> Client able to request passcode for expired fill &amp; sign request. Problem: There was no existing check for the request being expired before sending an SMS passcode. This led to the situation where a passcode could be sent for an expired request, causing the link to simply go back to the request page. Resolution: A check was added for whether or not the request was expired on the click of the 'Send SMS" button, and an error message was added for when the request is expired: "The Request is no longer valid. Please contact your agent and have them send you a new request." <br></br>Areas Impacted: External requests: specifically client fill and client fill and sign when SMS text is selected for a client</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 268909 </b> Drop-down items customized by a rule are retained when activity is copied. Problem: When a setcomboitems rule executes, the customized drop-down items are stored in a data item for the field that is suffixed with _ItemSource_GeneratedDataItem_PostFix. When an activity is copied, these data items are also copied, and if the copy is to a different carrier or product that does not dynamically set the drop-down values, the dynamic drop-down list from the previous product will still be in effect on the copy. Resolutions: Clear dynamic drop-down data items when copying an activity, and corrected the logic to clear the drop-down postfix data items before running rules instead of after<br></br>Areas Impacted: Copying of activities with rule-generated drop-down lists</p>

Problem: Changes related to updating jquery-ui version for security finding (iConnect 254935) introduced a problem, and the id tag was no longer being set for buttons like the Create button on new activity, which prevented disabling the button. Resolution: Updated the jquery-ui library to assign the id tag. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Buttons and other elements in FireLight UI, and behavior tied to the element ID.</p>

This is happening in the legacy forms UI, and when copying with changes, but not on copy-as is, and not when opening an existing activity in the combined wizard+forms UI, so if rules had previously set data items to invisible or disabled, but those rules were removed or commented out, data items would remain disabled or invisible.
