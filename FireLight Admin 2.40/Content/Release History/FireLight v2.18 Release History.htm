                <p>This workflow offers concierge service workflow that is extendable to any FireLight organization. When complete, organizations is able to manage nearly all functionality related to this workflow through the FireLight Admin tool; availability by organization/role, custom action button configuration, and email design/content through template.

                        <p>We are aware that alternative entry methods are being explored by some of our clients, i.e., OCR scanning, etc. This step need not be manual, but that will depend on the back-office process defined by each client. The significant aspect is that the application is initiated by someone other than the writing agent.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>In Good Order applications are Submitted.</li>
                    <li>If the application is NIGO and the agent is not an existing FireLight user, the back-office initiates creation of the agent in FireLight, transfers ownership of application to that agent, and notifies and provides access to the application through an email to agent. All actions stated is triggered though a single click of a custom action button.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once ownership of the activity is transferred to the new user, the back office will no longer have visibility of that application unless case access is granted to the transferee's role code through the back office group settings in the Admin.</p>

                    <li>After clicking on the Login link, the email, the agent is taken directly to Data Entry for the specific application that requires their attention.

Continuing with the changes that were  made in the 2.17 release, this enhancement is to improve the triage practices for the API functionality.

The Tracing capabilities for the Trace Table has also been enhanced, and the Application ID was also added to the API Insights page, allowing greater detail to be displayed on each trace ID.

For instance, if I had an Admin Role code, and within my queue 1, I could also act be a supervisory role and be able to unlock all of the activities within that queue.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230545 </b> USPS Address Verification was not working. A couple of problems on the Address Validation rule node in regards to Lob.com (our service provider for this functionality): the URL we had configured no longer existed, the JSON response structure we were expecting was no longer the same (leading to parsing problems), and we had a bug with the security credentials (we were sending the encoded URL as the Auth header instead of the encoded key). It seems that we were previously still getting through even with the incorrect credentials, but now, on the new URL, they are rejecting us.<br />Areas Impacted: Just the Address Validation rule node</li>

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 214179 </b> Deleted Packages show up in Sales Agreement &amp; FireLight UI. Deleted packages were appearing under the assigned packages view. This was resolved. Added clause to query to exclude packages.<br />Areas Impacted: EGApp - Creating or copying an activity.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 219575 </b> IsMatchNode Handles Blank or Null Values Poorly. Incorrect logic was in place to determine if a match is valid, to handle null values. This was resolved. The correct logic was implemented instead. Now it will return as not matching when applicable. We had to back out the change due to a number of iConnect issues that came in—see iConnect 229566. This will need to eventually be re-addressed, but we are not sure how we is able to resolve it, given the overall dependence on how the Regex Match rule node currently functions. This was re-opened and is now a Change Request.<br />Areas Impacted: Review Queue, Eapp</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 229497 </b> The setrowvisibility rule does not work in conjunction with table nodes. Table and setrowvisibility did not work together and setrowvisibility could not be used inside the table node. This was resolved. Made it so setrow visibility is not overwritten by table and added two new nodes <a href="../Product Configuration/Rule Sets/AdvancedRulesCategoryElementDefinitionsReference.htm#rowpropset">rowpropset</a> and <a href="../Product Configuration/Rule Sets/AdvancedRulesCategoryElementDefinitionsReference.htm#rowpropget">rowpropget</a>.<br />Areas Impacted: Rules, table nodes</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 229566 </b> Certain regex rules are no longer working. Regex rules were not returning in a similar way as with 2.17 due to a previous fix that had changed them to return in a more ideal way (see ic 219575). This was resolved by rolling back the change to the Regex rule node that had been previously changed.<br />Areas Impacted: Regex Match rule node</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 229966 </b> Purge policy minimum allowed values and validation. Activity Page: set minimum 5 days validation for Complete/Incomplete Purge policy. This was resolved. Fixed by applying minimum 5 days validation and also modified purge service to set minimum to 5 days instead of 10/30.<br />Areas Impacted: Activities</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230887 </b> Deployments are allowed from Production, which deploys to Staging. A client accidentally deployed from Production, overwriting data in Staging.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230806 </b> Issues with search functionality in All Activities view. Activity Type and Status drop-downs in Advanced Search included the entire list of values instead of filtering on existing data. The script that converted the localized text didn't correctly convert the Activity Names. These issues were resolved. Modified advanced search to populate the same list as All Activities drop-downs for Activity Type and Status. Updated the SQL script to directly convert the Activity Name to the OrganizationText table. Also updated the existing data in UAT Next. The corrected data will get synced to UAT, Staging and Prod.<br />Areas Impacted: Advanced Search, Organizations with non standard Activity Names</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230978 </b> Advanced Search not working as expected. The problem only occurred for one role code when All Users was selected. This issue was resolved by no longer defaulting to All Users in Advanced Search (for role codes that have this capability) so the problem no longer occurs in the default case.<br />Areas Impacted: Advanced Search</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 231304, 231335 </b> Copy under all activities is copying actual illustration and not our upload template. With the changes for iConnect 227702, all form and wizard definitions were being cached.  But for template forms, this was ambiguous and could result in the wrong instance (original vs. upload) of the form definition being used. This was resolved. Changed to no longer cache template form definitions.  These definitions are typically small, so this should have a negligible impact on performance.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 216405 </b> Applications with missing or empty base FLI_ data items. We have not been able to determine the cause for the missing data items/values. It does not occur very frequently, and there is no obvious explanation for how this came about. Modified the base system to always reinitialize required base data items when opening an activity that is in data entry status, to hopefully allow the activity to be able to be opened and edited when this problem occurs. Followup revealed this is not a base issue.<br />Areas Impacted: All areas of activity creation and data entry (via wizard UI, legacy forms UI, REST API, embedded, review queue, new business service, automated business service).</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 218679 </b> Error opening application when form definitions have changed. When a form was not found in the database, the application threw an exception because the forms did not match what was expected. This was resolved. Instead of throwing an exception, the app now continues on to load the next form.<br />Areas Impacted: EGApp - opening an existing application; specifically when one of the forms has been deleted</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 222635 </b> Display Status changed After App is completed. The action LoadAgentSigning was called after the application completed. This could happen if the user has multiple browser tabs open, or by clicking the back button or possibly pasting a URL into the browser location. This was resolved. The above action updates the DisplayStatus before doing anything else. The action eventually will throw an exception if the request is invalid. The updating of the DisplayStatus is now moved later in the logic to prevent updating when the request is invalid.<br />Areas Impacted: E-Sign</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 227484 </b> Reinitialize base data items when opening an activity. We have not been able to determine the cause for the missing data items/values.

Too many errors were being counted on the account of some dataitems having multiple messages associated with them. This was resolved. Changed it so the percent is based on number of visible fields and on one error per dataitem.<br />Areas Impacted: Forms only</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 229049 </b> Unable to create new applications. The branding text that was in CSS is now in the DB. This text is written to the HTML at render instead of reading it from the CSS when it's needed. This means some text was stored in variables. In addition some text contains quotes, which causes issues with the text variable. This was resolved. All localized/branded text that is retrieved for the UI has its quotes replaced with escaped quotes. <br />Areas Impacted: Could affect anyone with custom branding text that contains quotes. Generally this is branding text that has some markup for styling</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230283, 230284, 230285, 230287 </b> Pop-Up Message when Data Entry is completed, after signatures are completed, after application is submitted, and incorrect Application Complete message. The logic to get the Popup Message did not include logic to return an empty string when the default value is used. This allows the UI to use the custom step message, which includes onclick logic. This was missed in the Localization conversion. This was resolved. Added the above logic into the GetPopupMessage function. <br />Areas Impacted : All activity popup messages that use the custom Step message previously defined in CSS.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 224023 </b> Performance - Slow query performance when obtaining GroupUser information. Query was running slowly. This was resolved.

Though unable to reproduce client's specific problem, updating the role code data items starting with FLI_ROLE_CODE when a post over user opens an application. This was resolved.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230573 </b> Indexed Forms cannot be selected during Print. The FormIndex wasn't being used during the update process. This was resolved.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230681 </b> History missing from other actions when activity is in signing. Changes in 2.18 had the effect of hiding the History option based on the user's rights to save the activity, which was incorrect. This was resolved. Removed the check for save permissions to determine whether History is available.<br />Areas Impacted: History link in Other Actions and toolbar menus</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230756 </b> Multiple Activities product - Previous button on Activity page returns to party 2. Problem was that onNavigateLastPage() was always using page 3 when called. This was resolved. Used value of PageCount instead when calling onNavigateLastPage(). <br />Areas Impacted: Multiple Activities Add Activity page</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 231006 </b> Carryover Defect – Package 1 Name of Documents Uploaded. Document Type was shown in case of template document. This was resolved. Modified code so that Document Tag displays instead of Document Type in case of template document.<br />Areas Impacted: Document Dialog</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 231052 </b> Error when opening Legacy Apps. The client was recently synced from UAT to UAT Next. Applications from the copied DB fail when opened because there are fields defined that do not have a DataItem. The collection of data items is somehow missing a dataitem. This causes an error when looping through the fields when rendering a form. This was resolved. The issue stemmed from the user having no role code, which is not likely, but could happen. Modified the code to prevent this in the future.<br />Areas Impacted: User with no role code opening up an already created application</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 231128 </b> Multiple Illustration can be attached to French application. The document tag had been altered to show the document type in the uploaded list.  It needs to be set to the document tag in order for the check for the document tag that disables the uploading of multiple document tags as we verify using the list of uploaded documents. This was resolved by the fix for iConnect 231006 that changed the Document Type back to the Document Tag.<br />Areas Impacted: Document upload in forms only apps</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 231711 </b> Error when opening locked activity with forms hidden from data entry. The changes for iConnect 230992 had a side effect of, for a locked activity, no longer showing non-signing-ceremony forms that are hidden from data entry, resulting in an error opening the activity when this resulted in no visible forms. This was resolved. Corrected the logic so that such forms is visible.<br />Areas Impacted: Viewing of locked activities with only hidden from data entry forms visible</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 231738 </b> Error When Printing default app package documents in Display/Print PDF Option. Changes for iConnect 222539 added a check for field visibility, but introduced an error if the data item for the related field does not exist. This was resolved. Add a null check for the data item when determining visibility.<br />Areas Impacted: Display/Print PDF</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.Postpone"><b class="DRnumber">DR 232108 </b> Activity can be locked when not at 100%. iConnect 204072 change request (which was in the 2.18 release but not documented) introduced a bug that allows locking of activities not at 100% with Allow NIGO submit disabled.  The implementation was incorrectly executing all rules again, which can alter data items (FLI_PERCENT_COMPLETE and others) and introduce validation messages/errors to the application state, causing issues with review queue processing, signing ceremony, and downstream outbound processing. The design and implementation of that issue needs to be reevaluated (see attached). This bug is for tracking the rollback of this feature to resolve the immediate issues caused by it.

An Audit Report created on the newly deployed 2.17 code base in Staging is missing a space when referencing multi-signature roles. For example, "Replaced Policy Ownerand Owner." See attached Audit Report. This occurs in different places and for different sets of roles. This was resolved.<br />Areas Impacted: Audit Reports with multi-signature roles</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 225201 </b> Form Name Empty on Audit Report. Form Name was blank for Form Selected event types.

Template rule was originally not running on copied apps, so the required template did not prevent the app from being completed.  Currently, the copied app could not even be opened on the console.  Copied apps were not getting the original rule sets and sycDataitems folders.  This prevented the copied app from being opened on the console and the template rule from triggering in the copied app. This was resolved.<br />Areas Impacted: Apps that are checked out on the console that are copied and that have templates that are required.</li>

Added check for the display status for the agent case to verify it is in the correct status to create the child cases.  This will prevent duplicate browsers from performing the same action twice when the first action has changed the display status of the parent case.<br />Areas Impacted: E-Delivery</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 228260 </b> Application complete without client not completing signing ceremony. There was a database call that was periodically conflicting with another call, causing the table to lock.  This caused the agent case to not update the display status, staying in Agent Review, and not inserting the client requests that were sent out. Resolved the database call causing the conflict.<br />Areas Impacted: E-Delivery</li>

The passcode email is in the Review Queue category with a label of "Post-Submit Review Request Passcode."  But it can be sent for multiple situations: external sign, client fill/sign, e-review, so it is not obvious how to locate and update. This was resolved.

That dropdown was getting localized based on the FL_ProductTypes enumeration. Knights had a value for FL_ProductTypes.PolicyAdministration which does not exist.

There was logic to load a localized image from CSS which was removed and replaced with loading the image from a localized file. This was done because all layout and styling is done through CSS and image files instead of through the database. Also, client is passing in a branding identifier that is the same as their org identifier. The branding identifier currently overrides the localized image. This was resolved. Added the localized png logo and updated the logic to recognize when branding was the same as the Org Map Code.<br />Areas Impacted: Clients with localized logos</li>

When directly logging into EGApp, the user's email address was not getting updated from their STS email address property. Since the database was not getting updated, the users were not showing up in the Transfer list. This was resolved by updating the user's session info and database email address property from the STS email address property when they login to EGApp to ensure that the user will show up in the Transfer list and have an email address value set in Preferences. One side effect of how this was originally implemented is that, in addition to the email address being passed into FireLight, the direct login username (which is often an email address) is now mapping into the agent's name in preferences. This was resolved by modifying the logic for direct logins to only update the email address in Preferences and not the agent name.<br />Areas Impacted: Directly logging in to EGApp, STS, Preferences, Transfer menu option from Other Actions menu.</li>

When reviewer apps are created they should be marked as IsHidden = true to exclude them from Home or All Activities. This was resolved. Set IsHidden flag on reviewer applications so that they is hidden from home and all activities.  Removed logic to filter based on OSJ.ReviewerApplicationID.  Created migration script to convert reviewer apps to hidden. (2) When displaying Activity images in the UI, FireLight uses the Transaction Type to determine the correct image. It currently throws an exception when the transaction type is not recognized.

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 225074, 229951</b> Agent Signature was duplicating in Signing Ceremony. Agent signature was applied to the signature pad with two different fonts. Also, e-Signatures were incomplete on applications. The typed version of the client name was being applied in the signature pad view even though the stored version of the signature was signed using the signature pad. Both issues were resolved. The delay in the filling of the typed name on the signature pad in order to load fonts combined with the speed of the connection caused the name to be applied first with the default font and then with the loaded custom fonts.  The timing delay for the text signature was removed and issue with the delay in loading of fonts was instead fixed with a page load listener.  The pre-filled agent name is filled when the page and signature fonts have been loaded.   Also removed an additional call to fill the agent pre-fill text as this will now be handled when the page is loaded.<br />Areas Impacted: Collection of signatures for agent and client signing in the signature pad view.</li>

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 212918 </b> Spacing between question and fields_Text boxes_Check box_Radio. Extra vertical space was added between wizard components in order to improve layouts. Because your wizard uses separate label components instead of the labels built into text boxes (as textbox labels cannot be changed via rules), the space was still being reserved for the text box label which was adding empty vertical space between the text box and any components above it. This was resolved. When no text label is set on a text box, the space for the label is no longer reserved.<br />Areas Impacted: Text boxes with no labels in all wizards.</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 213784 </b> Wizard does not scroll when advancing between fields via keyboard. When buttons are tabbed they have no styling to tell them apart.

When a datepicker field was created without a mask being specified, a default mask of 99/99/9999 was being assigned so that validation could still be performed on the date. This differed from the forms implementation, where a date field with no mask had no validation performed (other than a rule, if one was written). This was resolved. Wizard fields have been updated to not use a default mask if one is selected, so any format of date can be entered.<br />Areas Impacted: All wizard datepicker fields, as well as any form calendar fields that are used alongside a wizard (including embedded).</li>

Previous Form Caching logic had changed how we were loading the properties of fields and pages on all Forms (iConnect 227702), which was primarily affecting fields. This was resolved. The main benefit of Form Caching was to skip deserialization,  so the field &amp; page looping logic was put back in the necessary place in order to have all the properties correctly set, without taking out the advantage of the caching.<br />Areas Impacted: Form &amp; Wizard loading (basically, whenever an app/activity is loaded up), and the definitions on fields, pages, and the forms/wizards themselves.</li>

            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230992 </b> Unwanted characters appears on the page. The error was no longer displayed in the wizard UI, but the behavior was affected by continuously writing spurious error messages on the server. There were two issues: (1) locked activities are rendered in the legacy forms UI, which was always generating a placeholder error field for each non-template form, but this should only be done when an activity is in data entry status, since no additional errors can occur when rules are not running and (2) after unlocking a previously locked wizard activity (now containing the placeholder field), the wizard UI was unaware of this placeholder field type and initialized it with a type of "None" (0).  This resulted in a spurious error message "COMPONENT '0' NOT IMPLEMENTED" being displayed in the wizard UI. These issues were resolved: (1) modified the legacy forms model to not create the error placeholder field for locked activities, (2) modified  the wizard UI to: a) handle the error placeholder field type by rendering as a label instead of showing an error message.  (NOTE: the placeholder is defined with coordinates of 1, 1, 1, 1, and I'm not sure if the wizard UI will render such a label properly – changes may be required for rule errors to show properly) and b) continue to log error messages for an unsupported field type (all types should be supported at this point) to the server and client UI.<br />Areas Impacted: Wizard UI</li>
            <li><b class="DRnumber">DR 230995, 231189 </b> Wizard - issue with background color of labels. Labels were being used to hide text on a pdf with text labels put over top.  The text from the pdf was still showing through. This was resolved. The labels on the form did not have a background color set and when the form is included in a wizard package, the labels were being set to transparent instead of white.  This had been corrected with the resolution of another bug.  This was changed back to a default of white for this release. <br />Areas Impacted: Background of any form field converted to wizard.</li>
