        <h1><a name="top"></a>FireLight v2.23 Release History</h1>
        <h2>2.23.83 March 29 UAT / April 1, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 260133 </b> Illustration API - FLI_SUB_FIRM_ID not being passed to FS. Problem: With the common tag data item changes in the Feb. release (2.23), several places that previously added or updated data items were now only updating the data item if it existed, and were no longer adding the data item if it didn't exist. Resolution: Corrected the code to add the data item if it doesn't exist. <br />Areas Impacted: Illustration API, "FLI_" prefixed data items passed in the request, AppManager.RequestTxLife103, AdditionalDataItems property, EditWizardController.UploadParticipantDocument (enrollment activity)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 260507 </b> Enrollment activity not working in Production due to reliance on benchmarking logic. Problem: The implementation of the enrollment feature inadvertently relies on the benchmarking feature, and because benchmarking is not enabled in Production (by design), this causes problems with enrollment workflow. Resolution: Enabled the initial rule run logic for benchmarks in Production so the enrollment activity initialization will work correctly.  The actual benchmark functionality will remain disabled. <br />Areas Impacted: Initialization of applications from enrollment activity</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.23.81 March 17 UAT / March 18, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Activities</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 254472 </b> Rulesets do not appear to run until saved. Problem: We are becoming more suspicious that this problem is due to caching.  We actually cache the rule script code as well as the deserialized rule definitions.  The script code is cached internally, but the cached definitions are exposed to the rules engine, and if the cached definition was modified in some way, it could conceivably result in behavior like you are describing.  Whenever a rule set is saved, it is discarded from the cache and reloaded from the database, which could explain why the problem clears up for a time after saving a rule set.  Then at some later point, if the cached definitions change, the strange behavior could recur.  Cached items are also dropped out of the cache after 2 hours, which could explain the problem disappearing for periods of time. We're not seeing where the rule definitions would be modified, but it seems worth it to at least rule that out as a possibility.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, then we will know it wasn't the cause. Resolution: Modified the rule set caching to only cache the rule script code and not rule definitions. Note that this could have an impact on memory usage and processing time when loading rules for activity data entry. <br />Areas Impacted: Loading and execution of rules</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 254568 </b> Illustration to Application, not able to edit App. Problem: Updating from an illustration would make the transferred data items readonly, regardless of the 'Lock Transferred Data Items' setting in the Illustration activity. Resolution: 'Lock Transferred Data Items' setting in the Illustration activity when updating existing app from an illustration.  NOTE: organizations that want the data items to be readonly will need to check 'Lock Transferred Data Items' in their Illustration activity if they want to retain the old behavior. <br />Areas Impacted: Read-only state of transferred data items in Update from Illustration</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DRs 258960, 259439 </b> Illustration - Value with % sign are divided by 100 and Annuities - Index allocations changing after generating illustrations. Problem: The Data Item conversion for 2.23 caused a change to the illustration app data mapping to modify the application's original data when converting the data to an appropriate format for the web request. This caused percentages to change in the app after running an illustration, as well as modifying some other fields of data. Resolution: We new create a new data items collection at the beginning of the mapping process that isolates the changes from the original data. <br />Areas Impacted: FireLight Illustrations App Data Mapping</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;258973 </b> Policy number no longer seen on copied apps during signing ceremony and on generated PDF. Problem: Data items changed by rules were sometimes not sync'ed back to the data items collection. Resolution: Correctly sync'ed the rules changes to the data items collection in all scenarios after the rules run. <br />Areas Impacted: Form only - Initializing and reinitializing the forms model</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 259423 </b> UI Not Refreshing after CustomAction. Problem: Async task data changes were not applied correctly and therefor the rules didn't run until the selected page is already validated and processed. Resolution: Committed the async task changes immediately and run rules before we validate the selected page. <br />Areas Impacted: Processing pending async task data changes</p>
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 259604 </b> Designer not allowing field names with | vertical bar character. Problem: The merge into the release branch mistakenly reverted the change for iConnect 256066, reintroducing that bug into the 2.23.79 release. Resolution: Put back the original code prior to the merge.<br />Areas Impacted: Allowed field names in the form and wizard designer</p>
            </li>

        <h2>2.23.79 March 4 UAT / March 8, 2022 Production Patch Release</h2>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;259110 </b> Application errors when selecting commission/fee option at the beginning of Rate Lock apps. Problem: Changes for common tags could result in an error executing rules when syncing the data item collection if it recorded the removal of a common tag data item that didn't exist. Resolution: Added a null check to skip removal of a non-existent data item. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Data entry with common tags</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="DRNumberBold">Addendum Forms with Localized Text</b>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;258856 </b> Addendum headers in French are wrapping and causing text to overlay. Problem: The French text in the header is longer than the English version. The space provided for the rendering was not large enough and the text was wrapping and overlaying. Resolution: Changed the layout of the two header items. The French text wraps and does not interfere with the second column header. <br></br>Areas Impacted: This should only affect Localized Clients using Addendum forms</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 258951 </b> Unable to edit rules from wizard designer. Problem: Changes for iConnect 250574 "Lock notification to prevent multi-user overwriting - Rule Set, Form and Wizard" introduced a bug that could result in an array index being exceeded because the code was using the active rule position (within the selected rule set) to index into the rule set collection. Resolution: Corrected the code to use the active rule set for lock information, instead of looking up a rule set in the collection based on the active rule position. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Editing of rules for the selected field from the wizard designer</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 259025 </b> Checked Canadian provinces are unchecking themselves on rule sets after saving. Problem: Changes for iConnect 250574 "Lock notification to prevent multi-user overwriting - Rule Set, Form and Wizard," the result being that it isn't loading the jurisdiction approvals for higher jurisdiction IDs (&gt; 63).  If the rule set is then saved, without those jurisdictions being re-checked, those jurisdictions will no longer be approved for the rule set when utilized in app. Resolution: Fixed to load additional jurisdiction approvals that are stored for the rule set. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Display of jurisdiction approvals in Admin -&gt; Rule Sets</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;258915 </b> Suitability paperwork is not displaying in Print Forms. Problem: When the activity runs rules for the first time when opening a packages gets included. This new package gets included in the users session but does not get saved correctly to the DB. When printing the DB is queried and the correct packages are not listed. Resolution: This was a timing issue. The model that manages the current "Save" state of the activity was not initialized and the IsDirty flag on the model was not getting set early enough. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Embedded activities that add/remove packages on initial startup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 259188 </b> Loading of PDFs for print not working from BO doc service or REST API. Problem: Loading of documents for the BODocumentService.PrintPDFs method is no longer loading documents.  This is a side effect of the fixes for iConnect 254670, which changed the call to get the application information in such a way that the app packages are no longer loaded, which is now required when loading of the documents for print in GetPrintPDFs -&gt; LoadPrintOrder -&gt; GetFormDefinitionListForPrint (due to changes for iConnect 257996). NOTE: This issue also impacts the REST API GetDocumentList and GetActivityPDF calls. Resolution: Corrected the code to load the app packages. <br></br>Areas Impacted: BODocumentService.PrintPDFs, REST API GetDocumentList, GetActivityPDF</p>

Problem: The provider call from the rules engine was passing the data items collection without the recent rules changes. Resolution: Pass the updated data item collection. <br></br>Areas Impacted: Rules engine calls to provider.</p>

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DRs 258908, 258921 </b> Reviewer Documents - Expected values from application not mapping into Reviewer Documents. Problem 1: Changes for common tags had the effect of activity data items from the source activity no longer transferring to the first reviewer documents app. Resolution: Corrected the logic to copy the data items. Problem 2: The logic to load the original activity data into the reviewer doc app was still not working correctly if the reviewer document form contained fields with common tags. Resolution: Exclude common tag data items when determining whether to copy the source activity data items. Patched Production on 3/2/2022.<br></br>Areas Impacted:&#160;The first reviewer docs app for an activity in the review queue (sequential queue copying of data was not affected), pre-filled data on the first reviewer docs app for an activity in the review queue</p>

            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;258926 </b>  Wizard - issues with field values and form inclusion during data entry - The Ownership Structure will not hold the value. Problem 1:  The dynamic drop-down would generate the correct drop-down values but would lose the values if you turn the page.  It would hold the values if it was not a newly created app. Resolution: The dataitem that holds the drop-down values was not being included in the list of dataitems for the page until after the rules had run and the model reinitialized when re-opening the case.  Moved the initializing of the page dataitems to after the rules dataitems are created. Problem 2: The dataitems were updating based on the conditional packages and the rules do not run in a consistent order, so sometimes it would not include the dataitem with the drop-down values when creating the page view and would only get added when the case was re-opened. Resolution: Added an update to the page map of dataitems to update the page maps if there have been dataitems updated based on the adding/removing of conditional packages. <br />Areas Impacted: Field updates in wizards, Conditional packages</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR&#160;259190 </b> Wizard - Dropdown (Combo Box) Options Blank when reloading activity. Problem: The issue is not due to it being a distributor, and is not due to setcomboitem rules.  For FPS-2980 (TFA), there are no such rules for SA_EMPLOYER_STATE. Rather, the issue is that the distributor has wizards in the sales agreement, so the combined forms+wizard UI is used for data entry rather than the legacy forms UI (which is used in the carrier).  Due to changes for iConnect 258527 (and possibly other scenarios), the "item source postfix" data item can be empty, and when the activity is reloaded, this results in the drop-down values being cleared (the same behavior that would [correctly] occur if the combo items rule did clear all of the items).  The check for the postfix data item should be treating an empty value as not being initialized from rules (since, if all items were removed, the string would contain an empty json list, which is not null or empty with the common tags changes that have been implemented). Resolution: If the drop-down item source postfix data item is empty, use the item source of the underlying field rather than initializing with an empty drop-down list. <br />Areas Impacted: Populating of combo drop-downs in the combined wizard+forms UI when reloading an activity.</p>

Problem:&#160;Some text values in the HTML were surrounded by single quotes. Those quotes were conflicting with quotes within the text itself and causing invalid HTML.

Problem: The common tag feature added an overhead to the creation of the activity data items collection since it needs to through all fields in the activity.

                <p><b class="DRnumber">DR 257624 </b> Apps getting 'stuck' after pre-submit review. Problem: This problem applies when an application has Pre-Signature Review enabled in its activity, and FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW is set to false. If the agent browses back to the application editing page while waiting on signatures to complete, then the process for automatically declining Pre-Signature Review will occur, which will put the app into a state that causes the continue button to get stuck. This seems to be the most common when an agent sends a email request for signing and then completes the agent signing section, then browses back to the application. Resolution: Added check on the application status for automatically declining Pre-Signature Review so the process occurs when locking, not again after locking. This automatic declining of Pre-Signature Review now will only occur if the application status is in a "ActiveApplication" (0) state or a "PendingReview" (7) state, and occurs for Wizards when locking, and Forms when continuing from the Edit Application page. There isn't a way to check if Pre-Signature Review has already been declined so checking to see if we are in the correct state to auto-decline Pre-Signature Review is difficult. This also means that there are a lot of different ways this fix can be tested.<br />Areas Impacted: Applications that use Pre-Signature Review and have FLI_REQUIREMANUALREVIEW set to false</p>

                <p>Problem (TFS 26998):  Occasionally, an application is submitted, is processed in the BeforeOSJ workflow, but then does not go through the Submit workflow, leaving the status at Submit Requested. Analysis of an occurrence found that the BeforeOSJ workflow completed, deleting of the workflow record timed out, which prevented the Submit workflow from being initiated, resulting in the above behavior. Resolution: Modify the workflow processing to ensure the Submit workflow is always initiated when the BeforeOSJ workflow processing finishes. </p>
                <p>Problem (TFS 29232): When inserting into the workflow via StartWorkflow, if a WorkflowInstance record already exists for that app, it just updates the workflow, but does not update the WorkflowType.  So if, for instance, a SendAppStatus workflow was initiated but failed, it would remain in the workflow, and if another workflow (for instance SubmitAfterOSJ) was started, it would remain as a 'SendAppStatus' workflow and the SubmitAfterOSJ workflow would never occur. Some workflow types are more important than others. If a SubmitAfterOSJ workflow was started, but remained due to a failure, a SendAppStatus workflow should not replace it in the workflow (but the reverse should).  Resolution: Modify UpdateWorkflow to update the WorkflowType for workflows other than status workflows. <br />Areas Impacted: Submission of applications</p>

So if a wizard was exported and imported into another organization, an error would occur in data entry for the app because the custom list could not be loaded (even if the referenced custom was added for that org, because it would have a different ID). Resolution: With the fix, it now also stores the custom list name in the wizard definition, and then looks up the custom list (for that org) by name, so the above scenario will now work (if the org has that custom list defined). <br />Areas Impacted: Wizard designer Data Grid and Custom Lists</p>

Problem: This is a data issue related to iConnect 250011 - in that iConnect ticket, we changed the internal queue IDs of all PreSubmit queues to match a specific pattern, and then modified the code to use that pattern to determine if a queue is a PreSubmit queue. A number of database syncs across multiple organizations have taken place since the corresponding sql script has been run, and so have overwritten the new PreSubmit queue ID pattern with the old IDs, and now the new code is no longer able to tell if a queue is PreSubmit, which ultimately leads to problems with the PreSubmit review step for any affected organization. Resolution: All these syncs are coming from the UAT databases. It has been determined that we will not be updating those databases (which would prevent the syncs from changing the PreSubmit queue IDs). So, anytime a sync occurs, this problem will come back for the given organization, and we will need to re-run the corresponding script for that organization.

                        <p>There is logic in the wizard UI to load custom lists for the activity, but it loads only the app organization's custom lists, so in a distributor organization, the carrier's custom lists were not getting loaded (originally reported in iConnect 208198, but never fixed).  The system compares the timestamp of the custom list with the associated grid information to determine if the grid data needs to be updated due to a list change, but because this list of custom lists doesn't include the carrier's, it always treats the grid data as out-of-date and proceeds to #2. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Elsewhere, there is logic in the wizard UI (implemented for iConnect 223527) to "Update the list definition for a grid without (read: attempting not to) replacing user entries."  This logic a) doesn't rely on the custom lists loaded in #1, b) assumes that there is a unique key column for the custom list data (which there isn't for custom list System SubAccounts, associated with grid field Allocation_Data_Grid) and c) apparently does replace user entries in some cases.  Because of issue #1, this replacement logic always executes when opening an activity in the distributor environment, which has the effect of assigning values from one row to other rows of the grid with the same ProductId, which results in the allocation values getting duplicated. </p>

Note that this could still result in the original bug reported in 223527 manifesting in some scenarios (if a custom list not having a unique key column is updated, in-flight apps' grid data associated with that custom list will not get updated).  And apparently the fix for 223527 is incomplete in that it does sometimes replace user entries, and that issue still exists, but will not occur in this scenario.
