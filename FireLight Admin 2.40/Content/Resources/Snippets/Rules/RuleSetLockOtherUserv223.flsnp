For other users who attempt to open the rule set while it is locked by the first user, the system displays:  "User &lt;username&gt; is currently working on the Rule Set" and disables the NEW RULE, DELETE ALL, and SAVE RULE SET action buttons.  Other users can only view and export rules or close the window while the rule set is locked.
