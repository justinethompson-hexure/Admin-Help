        <p>Select the <b class="Bold">Validate Rule Name Uniqueness</b> checkbox to require all new rule names to be unique. When this feature is enabled, on the  Form Designer or Wizard Designer page in the "Rules Window" when a new rule is added, it cannot be saved if the rule has the same name as any of the existing rules in Admin.  A "Rule name must be unique!" error message appears. You must provide a new name for the new rule. <img src="../../ImagesAdmin/Capture271.png" alt="Rule Name Must Be Unique Message" title="Rule Name Must Be Unique Message" MadCap:conditions="General.Online"></img></p>
