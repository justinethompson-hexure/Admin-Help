        <p>In the <b class="Bold">Maximum Upload File Size</b> lists, select the number of MB file size to allow for a <b class="Bold">Single</b> user  upload document and select the <b class="Bold">Cumulative</b> maximum upload file size for all user upload documents. This limits the size of documents that users can upload  from the Other Actions menu/Documents, or from a Button with the Action Type set to "Custom File Upload," from the review process in a Review Queue, or from Client Fill and Client Fill and Sign requests. A FireLight notification message appears when a user attempts to upload documents larger than the selected Single or Cumulative file size. If a carrier and distributor both have a maximum upload file size set, FireLight will use the most restrictive setting. If the file size of the PDF document exceeds the maximum Single or Cumulative file size limit, FireLight halts the document upload and displays a  notification message to the user. The maximum upload Single file size limit ranges from 1 MB to 50 MB in 1MB increments. The maximum upload Cumulative file size limit ranges from Null to 50 MB in 5 MB increments. If your organization has a smaller Single or Cumulative file size limit, FireLight will enforce the smaller file size limit. When a file is selected for upload, Individual file size and total file size of uploaded documents is displayed in the Documents dialog for an activity. Files are compressed at the server side before uploading them into the database. On the Documents Upload dialog, a note has been added about the possibility of any variance between the actual file size and the upload file size, reading “NOTE: Files will be compressed while uploading. There might be a variance in the actual file size and the uploaded file size displayed.”</p>
