    <body>Select the <b class="Bold">Print Submitted Only</b> checkbox to allow printing of activities only after the activities have been submitted to the PreSubmit review queue, transmitted, or submitted. The user must complete and submit the activity, transmit the activity, or the activity must be in the PreSubmit review queue before the option to Display/Print PDF is enabled in the Other Actions menu in FireLight. When a distributor and a carrier have different settings for the Print Submitted Only checkbox, the more restrictive organization setting is used. For example, when a distributor has the Print Submitted Only checkbox selected and the activity contains forms from a carrier who does not have this checkbox selected, the more restrictive distributor setting is used. When this checkbox is selected, the Allow NIGO Printing checkbox cannot be selected.</body>
