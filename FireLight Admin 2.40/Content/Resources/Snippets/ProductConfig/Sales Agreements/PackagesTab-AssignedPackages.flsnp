    <body>On the Packages tab, the Assigned Packages section contains the packages that are included in the sales agreement.  For example, carriers can add a reviewer dashboard forms package along with a product package. Distributors have the carrier package and can also have their own package of additional forms.  Below the package name in the <b>Package Duty</b> list, select whether the package is <b>Required</b> or <b>Conditional</b> in the Sales Agreement. Click the up arrow and down arrow to rearrange the order of the packages in the Sales Agreement. To the left of the <b class="Bold">Assigned Packages</b> section, click the left arrow to remove the package from the Assigned Packages section and move it to the Available Packages list. You can add Post-Issue Service Forms or Sub Pay forms to an existing product by including the post-issue maintenance or Sub Pay forms for the product as part of a specific maintenance type package. You can also create a product with a  Needs Determination form, Post-Issue Service forms or Sub Pay forms as the only approved transaction type.
