    <body>On the Custom Lists tab, the Assigned Custom Lists section contains the custom lists that are included in the Sales Agreement. To the left of the <b class="Bold">Assigned Custom Lists</b> section, click the left arrow to remove the custom list from the Assigned Custom Lists section and move it to the Available Custom Lists section. Carriers are using custom lists in combination with rules in FireLight to control allocations as it gives greater flexibility to manage distributor variations and date drive changes. Some carriers intentionally do not deploy all custom lists to all distributors. With custom lists added to sales agreements, it gives the carriers an opportunity to deploy custom lists with the All Configuration deployment scope. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Utilities/Deployments/Deploy Data.htm" target="_blank" alt="Deploy Data">Deploy Data</MadCap:xref> for deployment information.</body>
