    <body>In <b class="Bold">Hide Product CUSIP IDs</b>, enter comma-separated CUSIP IDs to define the products to hide from the product selection dropdown list for that activity on the create new activity page. This allows firms to hide products that are not ready for the agent to access in that activity. This might be used for distributors that want to make illustration available to agents so they cannot deactivate the activity, but need to hold a few products back from the illustration. Additionally, this can be used for firms that need the agents to go through the pre-sale for a product. The product can be hidden from the application drop-down but remain visible in the pre-sale dropdown list. This feature is present in both the carrier’s and distributor’s environments. However, they is independent of each other, meaning the carrier’s setting will not be part of the auto deploy to a distributor’s environment. Remove a CUSIP ID from the field to show it on the create new activity page.
