        <p>Select the <b class="Bold">Allow Pre-Signature Review</b> checkbox to allow electronic activity package reviews prior to the Signatures step. This adds the pre-submission Review workflow step after the Data Entry step and before the Signatures step  within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>. The pre-submission Review step involves adding the activity to a PreSubmit review queue within the activity submission review queue. </p>
        <p class="note">
            <b class="Bold">NOTES:</b> When the Allow Pre-Signature Review option is selected, users cannot check out an app on the Console  and users cannot select the Request Client Fill &amp; Sign option on the Other Actions menu.<br></br>If you always want to include the PreSubmit review in the workflow, select Allow Post-Signature Review instead of Allow Pre-Signature Review.</p>
