    <body><b class="Bold">Tip:</b>  The FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> system automatically locks a form or rule set for the first user who starts to make changes to the form or rule set in the Form Designer.  For other users who attempt to open the form while it is locked by the first user, the system displays a "User &lt;user name&gt; is currently working on the form" message on the form page and  disables the Rules Window link, Form Properties link, Form History link, and SAVE buttons.  Other users can only view, navigate between the pages, or close the form while the form is locked.

See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Design/Form Library/Lock and Unlock Forms for Editing.htm" title="Lock and Unlock Forms for Editing" alt="Lock and Unlock Forms for Editing">Lock and Unlock Forms for Editing</MadCap:xref> for instructions on how to lock the form from within the Form Library to prevent others from editing the form at the same time. </body>
