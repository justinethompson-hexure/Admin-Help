        <p><b class="Bold">Tip:</b>  The FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> system automatically locks a wizard or rule set for the first user who starts to make changes to the wizard or rule set in the Wizard Designer.  For other users who attempt to open the wizard while it is locked by the first user, the system displays a "User &lt;user name&gt; is currently working on the wizard" message on the wizard page and  disables the EDIT RULES link, the OK button on the Properties dialog, and the SAVE WIZARD button.  Other users can only view, navigate between the pages, or close the wizard while the wizard is locked.
