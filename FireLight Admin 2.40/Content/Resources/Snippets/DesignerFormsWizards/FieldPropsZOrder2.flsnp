    <body><b>Bring to Front </b> displays this control in front of the other control. <br /><b>Send to Back </b> displays this control behind the other control. <br /><img src="../../ImagesAdmin/TipIcon.jpg" alt="Tip Icon" title="" /> Z Order uses the order of the controls to determine which control is placed on top. Tab Index also uses the order of the fields. Set the <b>Tab Index</b> property to <b>0</b> if you want to use Z Order to place the  control behind another control. Or you can use the setvisibility rule node to conditionally set the visibility of the control you want to hide. See <a href="../../../Product Configuration/Rule Sets/AdvancedRulesCategoryElementDefinitionsReference.htm#setvisibility">|setvisibility</a> under "|Get Set" in the "Advanced Rules Category and Element Definitions Reference" topic.</body>
