        <p>(Optional) Enter placeholder text for the control. This text will display within the field as a prompt to the user. For example, enter "First Name" in Placeholder Text for the Owner_FirstName field on the form or wizard. This could potentially eliminate the need for adding Label controls to forms and wizards. Placeholder text will not appear on the printed/PDF version of the forms and wizards. <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> Placeholder Text will not be shown if a Text Mask is set.</p>
