    <body>Select the <strong>Recall Rejection</strong> checkbox to allow the user to recall rejected reviews back to the review queue from which it was rejected. This does not apply to the PreSubmit review queue. A Recall button appears on rejected reviews in the History section of the Review Queue. The user clicks the Recall button and confirms the recall to recall the rejected review and any documents including uploaded and reviewer documents. Application History and Application Audit include a message, "This application has been recalled from rejection by the reviewer '(abc)' and has been moved back to review queue '(xyz)'." The provider is connected to the review queue Reject Interface to know when a recall occurred. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online">For user instructions, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Review Queue Guide/History/Recall a Rejected Order and Return It to the Queue.htm" target="_blank" alt="Recall a Rejected Order and Return It to the Queue [Reviewer Instructions]">Recall a Rejected Order and Return It to the Queue  [Reviewer Instructions]</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></body>
