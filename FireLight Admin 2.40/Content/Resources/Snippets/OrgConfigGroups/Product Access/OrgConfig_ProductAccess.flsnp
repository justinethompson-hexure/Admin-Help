    <body><b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> Products without an active Sales Agreement do not appear on the Product Access tab.<p>On the <b>Product Access</b> tab, do the following.</p><ol><li>On the <b class="Bold">Organization Configuration/Groups</b> page, select a user group in the grid at the top of the page. If using Firm Orgs, products listed on the Product Access tab are limited to only products with an active sales agreement for the Firm Org.</li><li>Click the <b class="Bold">Product Access</b> tab.</li><li>Select the <b>Organization</b> for the user group in the list. For carrier organizations, the drop-down list will contain the carrier organization as well as any distributor that may have the carrier products.  For distributor organizations, the list will contain the distributor organization and all carrier organizations for which they sell products.</li><li>Select the checkboxes for the products that the user group can access or select the <b>Check/Uncheck All</b> checkbox to grant or remove the group access to all products. This will determine product access within the FireLight application.  Product availability can also be filtered within the organization’s integration provider.</li><li><p>If you are an Admin user and you would like to edit the state approvals for the individual products on the Product Access tab: </p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><p>Above the list of products, select the <b class="Bold">Enable State Refinement</b> checkbox.

This is due to the states being available via this new option being a subset of the states that are available in the Sales Agreement.</p><p>Adding a state in the Sales Agreement will NOT by default cause the state to be selected if the Enable State Refinement feature is enabled. Therefore, the Admin user will need to go into the State Approvals dialog for that Product in the Groups Product Access tab, and add it for the Product.</p></li></ol></li><li>If applicable, select the <b>Needs Determination</b> checkbox to allow the user group to access the <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Features/Needs Determination.htm" target="_blank" alt="Needs Determination">Needs Determination</MadCap:xref> feature. </li><li>If applicable, select another <b class="Bold">Organization</b> for the user group. With this selection, FireLight retains the selections made for the prior Organization until saving the Groups page. However, it is advisable to click <b class="Bold">Save</b> before selecting another Organization.
