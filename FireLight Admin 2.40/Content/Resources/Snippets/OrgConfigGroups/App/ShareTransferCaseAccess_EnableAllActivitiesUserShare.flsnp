        <p class="Indent">Select the <b class="Bold">Enable All Activities User Share</b> checkbox to allow the user to share all of their activities  with another user.  The available users to share with are based on the Organization and the Groups that have the Enable All Activities User Share option enabled and that matches the entered string for the user search. When this option is selected, the Share Cases icon is visible on the top left of the activities list on the All Activities page. The user clicks the icon to open the Share My Activities dialog and can search for another user with whom to share activities by User Name (the ID passed in the SSO or entered in direct login), User Full Name (entered in the user's Preferences or passed in the SSO), or External Map Code (often mapped to the user's email address).   Users can create Read Only and Full Control share requests, as well as cancel previous requests.  If the  Enable All Activities User Share option and the Disable Editing Other Users' Activities option are selected, the shared to user has only  Read Only access to shared activities. If one or more user groups are selected on the Case Access tab in Groups, all users within the selected groups have Full Control access to all activities, which can override any Read Only sharing with users in any of the selected groups. For information about group options that affect case access, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Organization Configuration/Groups/Case Access and User Share Comparison.htm" target="_blank" alt="Case Access and User Share Comparison">Case Access and User Share Comparison</MadCap:xref>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online">See also <MadCap:xref href="../../../../UserGuide/All Activities/Share Activities.htm" target="_blank" alt="Share Activities [User Instructions]">Share Activities [User Instructions]</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

            <b class="Bold">NOTE:</b> When Case Access by Firm ID and Enable All Activities User Share options are both selected, the "On Behalf of" list becomes available on the Create [Activity] dialog in FireLight. This is useful for firms that have assistants creating activities on behalf of agents. If the Case Access by Firm ID and Enable All Activities User Share options are both selected and the user has access to multiple offices or firms, an "Office" list becomes available on the Create [Activity] dialog in FireLight in addition to the  "On Behalf of" list. The user selects a user and an office for the new activity.</p>
