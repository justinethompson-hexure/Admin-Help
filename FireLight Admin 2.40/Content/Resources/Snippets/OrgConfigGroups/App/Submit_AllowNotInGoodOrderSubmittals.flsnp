    <body>Select the <b class="Bold">Allow Not In Good Order Submittals</b> checkbox to treat hard validation messages as warnings instead of exceptions, but retain the exceptions data as part of the transmission.  It allows the user to submit Not In Good Order activity packages to the back office. If this option is selected, the Activity History and Application Audit Admin Report will include a new line, "Activity 'Name of Activity' submitted with active group setting "Allow Not in Good Order Submittals."" This option supports Home Office workflows where they want to know what NIGO conditions exist on the activity, but still allow users to submit the activity with errors. Forms can also be developed with particular fields still being required with the NIGO option by using the option=”ForceError” node in the error message rule. Allow Not In Good Order Submittals option and Enable Auto Submit option can be selected with the Enable HTTP Redirect on Submit option.</body>
