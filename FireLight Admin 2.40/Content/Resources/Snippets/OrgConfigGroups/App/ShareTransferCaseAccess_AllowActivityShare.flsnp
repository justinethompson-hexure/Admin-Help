    <body>Select the <b class="Bold">Allow Activity Share</b> checkbox to allow the user to share a single activity with one or more users. The available users to share with are based on the Organization and the Groups that have the Allow Activity Share option enabled and that match the entered string for the user search. When the Allow Activity Share option is selected, it adds a Share option to the Other Actions menu while an activity is in edit mode.  The user clicks the Share option on the Other Actions menu to open the Share My Activities dialog and then searches for another user to share activities by User Name (the ID passed in the SSO or entered in direct login), User Full Name (entered in the user's Preferences or passed in the SSO), or External Map Code (often mapped to the user's email address).   Users can create Read Only and Full Control share requests as well as cancel previous requests.  If the  Allow Activity Share option and the Disable Editing Other Users' Activities option are both selected, the user shared to has only  Read Only access to a shared activity. If one or more user groups are selected on the Case Access tab in Groups, all users within the selected groups have Full Control access to all activities, which can override any Read Only sharing with users in any of the selected groups.
