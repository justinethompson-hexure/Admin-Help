    <body>Select the <b class="Bold">Active Agent User List</b> checkbox to restrict the list of agents in the User List on the All Activities page to only agents that have had activity since the last purge date. The Active Agent User List setting can have an effect on SSO logins that use "On Behalf Of" in their 1228/103. If an assistant is listed as a user in the 1228 and a different agent user is listed in the 103, and the agent has not created any activities recently, the agent user is not available in the User List, which can cause a permissions error.  <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online">See also <MadCap:xref href="../../../../UserGuide/All Activities/Filter Activities - User List.htm" target="_blank" alt="Filter Activities - User List [User Instructions]">Filter Activities - User List [User Instructions]</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></body>
