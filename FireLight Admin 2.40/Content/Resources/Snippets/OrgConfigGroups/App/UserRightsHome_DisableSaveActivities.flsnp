    <body>Select the <strong>Disable Save Activities</strong> checkbox to disable the ability to save activities and makes the Activity Summary dialog read only so the user cannot rename the activity, etc. It disables Auto Save ("Auto Save Enabled" does not display on the left of the menu bar in an activity).   The ability to save an activity is dependent on this option, as well as the status and ownership of the activity.  The activity must be active and either owned by the user or the user must have edit privileges for the shared activity.  The activity also cannot be saved if it is currently checked out to the console. Because the user cannot save changes to a case, the user also should not be able to continue to the signing process or submit an unsaved case. The Continue button should be disabled regardless of the state of the activity. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online"> See also Other Actions, <MadCap:xref href="../../../../UserGuide/FireLight Basics/Other Actions/Rename Summary.htm" target="_blank" alt="Rename/Summary" title="Rename/Summary">Rename/Summary [User Instructions]</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></body>
