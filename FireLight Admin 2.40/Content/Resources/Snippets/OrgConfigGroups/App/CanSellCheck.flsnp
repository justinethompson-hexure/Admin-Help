    <body><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: normal;">Please contact SuranceBay at 877-264-6888 or email info@surancebay.com before enabling the Can Sell Check with SuranceBay service. Then,  under Submit on the App tab, select from the Can Sell Check drop-down list <b>None</b>, <b>DTCC Producer Authorization</b>, or <b>SuranceBay Producer Eligibility</b>. Selecting DTCC Producer Authorization  validates producer requirements: soft stop or hard stop for an application and determining the Producer's eligibility to sell the product (the default behavior is soft stop, and the Producer will be alerted if they fail to meet the expected criteria set by the carrier). Selecting SuranceBay Producer Eligibility enables the ability of a group to perform can-sell checking within FireLight. Can-sell checking is available for Life and Annuity products. Producer requirements appear in a new section of the Application Selection page, and just-in-time updates to producer status are available by browsing SureLC. After selecting SuranceBay Producer Elgibility, the following message appears, "Selecting this service will automatically call SuranceBay Can-Sell integration."</b>
