            <li>When the carrier Admin user selects a distributor in the Distributor Testing View list on the FireLight Home page, the user sees only the carrier products and activities for their own carrier organization that the distributor allows the carrier to access. This is done via a distributor role code that manages carrier product and activity access.</li>
            <li>The carrier Admin user can submit an activity using the Distributor testing role code and the outbound submission (App/Sub or 103 or Name Value Pairs) is sent. This allows carriers to do full end-to-end testing on the distributor and make sure the outbound files are correct.</li>
            <li>This view is only available in the UAT environment for testing. It is not available in Production. </li>
