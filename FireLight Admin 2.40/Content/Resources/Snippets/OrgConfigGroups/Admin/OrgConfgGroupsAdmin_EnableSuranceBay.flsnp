        <p>Please contact SuranceBay at 877-264-6888 or email info@surancebay.com before enabling the Can Sell Check with SuranceBay service.  Then, select the <b class="Bold">Enable SuranceBay</b> checkbox in the Group &gt;&#160;Admin tab to enable the ability of a group to perform can-sell checking within FireLight. Can-sell checking is available for Life and Annuity products. Producer requirements appear in a new section of the Application Selection page, and just-in-time updates to producer status are available by browsing SureLC. After this checkbox is selected, the following message appears, "Checking this service will automatically call SuranceBay Can-Sell integration."</p>
