        <h1><a name="top"></a>Deploy Data</h1>
        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To receive deployment notification emails, enter one or more email addresses in the <a href="../../Organization Configuration/Organizations/Organization.htm#DeploymentNotificationEmail" target="_blank" alt="Deployment Notification Email">Deployment Notification Email</a> field on the Organization tab of the Organizations Settings page in Organization Configuration.</li>
            <li>When viewing or uploading Fee data in UAT, it is actually stored in Staging.  This is because there is only one DTCC test region, which is another potential source of the fee data for carriers that utilize it, and regardless of the source (manual upload or DTCC), the fee data is stored in the FireLight<sup MadCap:conditions="General.Online">®</sup> DTCC subsystem.  It is accessible from UAT and/or Staging to allow testing in either environment, but it resides only in Staging.  Fee data that comes from DTCC cannot be deployed – instead, it must be passed through the DTCC production region.</li>
            <li>Carriers use the non-Distributor configurations in Synchronization Scope to deploy their data to the next carrier environment, and they use the Distributor configurations to deploy their products/packages/forms to distributors.</li>
            <li>Distributors use the non-Distributor configurations  in Synchronization Scope to deploy the distributor products/packages/forms, etc., to the next distributor environment, and they use the Carrier Only configurations to deploy the carrier products/packages/forms, etc., to the next distributor environment.</li>
            <li>When Auto Deploy is enabled in UAT on the <MadCap:xref href="../../Product Configuration/SalesAgreements.htm" target="_blank" alt="Sales Agreements">Sales Agreements</MadCap:xref> page in Product Configuration, auto deploy will be in effect for all carriers to that distributor from carrier UAT to distributor Staging. Otherwise, if the distributor enables Auto Deploy in Sales Agreement settings for a given Carrier Org, auto deploy will be in effect for that carrier to the distributor from carrier UAT to distributor Staging. In Staging, if the distributor organization enables Auto Deploy in Organization settings &gt; Admin, auto deploy will be in effect for all carriers to that distributor from carrier UAT to distributor Production (or from carrier Staging to distributor Production). Otherwise, if the distributor enables Auto Deploy in Sales Agreement settings for a given Carrier Org, auto deploy will be in effect for that carrier to the distributor from carrier UAT to distributor Production (or from carrier Staging to distributor Production). </li>
            <li>If a carrier has the Deploy Email Group added on the Sales Agreements page for a distributor, the distributor emails recipients are notified of carrier deployments that may affect the users' experience for that carrier's deployment configurations in the distributor environment, regardless of the distributor Auto Deploy setting.</li>
            <li>The system does not allow deployments from Production to prevent overwriting data in Staging.</li>
            <li>
                <p>When an admin user for a Firm Org is logged in, they have access to Deployments. However, that access is greatly restricted. Admin users of the Firm Orgs have the Synchronization Scope default to "Group Configuration," and that is the only item available to them from the dropdown list. The list of Groups  they see is only Groups that are associated with their organization.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Use the Deployment tab on the Deployments page to move new or updated data from the UAT environment (where all of your development and your testing occurs) to the Staging environment and then to the Production environment. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure you are logged in to the correct environment (UAT or Staging) for the deployment. </p>
                <p>

                    <li>Leave the checkbox cleared to have the deployment comparison from the carrier UAT to the farthest distributor environment (Production if Auto Deploy is enabled in UAT and Staging).

                    <li>
                        <p>Select the checkbox to have the deployment first compare with the next immediate environment, and if any differences are detected, those changes are used for the deployment to all destination environments. This enables deployment to out-of-sync intermediate environments to succeed and be brought back into sync. It is possible that a deployment is successful but not complete to all higher environments, requiring deploying again (one or two times until the items no longer show for deployment) to get all environments updated with the latest changes. Once all environments are back in sync, this option can be cleared, and a single deployment successfully updates all environments.</p>
