        <h2>Activity Reports</h2>
        <p>The following topics contain reporting options available through our automated activity reporting tool. Each report can be sent in CSV or PDF format and is sent on an automated schedule to an organization email. A distribution email is best as it allows you to change your recipients as needed and allows the report scheduler to run efficiently. The activity reports have default data columns.  Some configuration, such as optional columns, are available.  The activity reports can provide summary and detailed data about transaction activity, but do not have access to specific form data that is not stored outside of the encrypted form data.</p>
